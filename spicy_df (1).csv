"1","57936251","2.75 stars ✩⋆when i saw that this book has groveling, best friend's brother, grumpy/sunshine trope, touch her and i'll kill you, i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don't know why but this book just made me evaluate my life- myself. why do you ask? well, 
  WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ⤵ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE
:
  ""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he'll end up in pieces, and you'll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""
and at first i was like because there's things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men: 
1. i hate bossy men (pls- i'm bossy enough as it is)2. toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3. if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4. if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ✋and normally, my attitude is why do men but when i read this? i don't know myself anymore.i don't know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don't.but anyways, going back to the book, i like both Ava (h) and Alex (H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that's too much perfection ma'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because ✧ Bridget is a literal princess (i'm not joking)✧ Jules is jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book) ✧ Stella is this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother's best friend book the girl is always pining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i'm glad that's not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall, this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are some tw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse -`,✎ 
  WHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?
➳ since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the whole Operation Emotion thing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:
  ""She was mine. She just didn't know it yet. I hadn't known it myself until I saw her in Colton's arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""
i only sensed attraction but i didn't get the feeling they were already at the ""she's mine, he's mine"" stage. one chapter he's acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava's pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance. ➳ telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i'm the type of person who wants to know everything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn't really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wanted all the details of how they are as a couple and we didn't really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it's mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳ Vicious reincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳ OW dramadon't worry, it's nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don't worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava's face:
  ""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""
and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i'm into, i will dip because that's an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you're telling me you're gonna fuck your girl the same way you've fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎ 
  OVERALL THOUGHTS
again, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you're just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma'am i want to see everything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don't see Alex being all soft towards Ava. i'm excited for the next book, aka Bridget's book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name is RHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━

"2","57936251","OH BOYYYYYYY! LET'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.  Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don't doubt it. I don't think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable. Can't say the same thing for her characters.   NOTHING in this book or even it's cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attempt every single trope in the history of the universe with a single story, so you can't really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.   You get brother's best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn't date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela. However, I HAVE TO MENTION the best trope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The ""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!"" but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)  Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won't kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family's company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.   IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN. But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.  He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It's like a wish version of Batman. Except Batman is actually cool.   He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY'S license, because it obviously didn't work.  Alex, and I quote:  ""Is not a TOY, so don't play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.  But yeah, Alex's broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that ""biological reactions can be mastered""  Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don't fucking explode   Our female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)  Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.  It's so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don't go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable. She succeeded.   Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.  ""I am turning you into my fuck doll"" (?????????????? I mean if you want her unresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail. I haven't decided yet.)  He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a: ""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""   Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she ""can feel the power it emanates"". I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.  Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex's penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn't tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:  ""my daddy is a lawyer""  in third grade.  It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It's all I needed. It's embarrassing enough on it's own. I hardly did any work here.  Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let's see.  Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.  *wipes sweat off brows*",1
"3","57936251","the red in the flag that is alex volkov is from all my brain cells he has murdered, and the blood of the people he has actually murdered 😍 everybody who said he begged and grovelled for a year LIED, i hope you guys have to wear wet socks for the rest of ur lives 🤠 he spends half a year preparing to stalk ava, and then does that for the next half. no tears were shed on his end, i demand my money back. i wanted to be nice to this book just because of how unintentionally hilarious and satirical it was, but then he 
  sang
 and all of that was out the window. i respectfully don't care enough about the plot to go into details about it, but if you must know, it was very poorly executed and i did not care one bit for anything that was going on.i do want to elaborate on the absolute JOY that alex and ava are though 🥰 apparently miss huang agrees bec they're her favorites.meet, Alex(H): he has a god complex you can't rival, a dick for days, a massive ego, works as a full-time stalker for six months, will get jealous of a fly if it dares to hover around ava for more than a second, thinks he's the most special mf on god's green earth, isn't scared of anything not even wild animals, has HSAM (Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory) that he uses to relive a traumatic event of his past bec he's weird like that, is a walmart version of Christian Grey, and he's so freaking smart that he quadrupled his investments and also became a millionaire in high school because of a technology he invented 🥺💅🏻 doesn't he sound like an absolute bombastic slay? let me tell you he's acc not. alex is a man written by a woman who has probably never had any interaction w a man before he's so cringey you won't believe it - but I'll let him speak for himself 😵‍💫╰─▸ ❝Nothing turned me off more than desperation, which reeked stronger than their perfume.❞says the guy that left his job and followed ava around for six months like a pathetic loser 🙏🏻╰─▸ ❝Besides, everyone knew I was the power behind the throne, anyway.❞power, throne, kingdom - shut ur fucking mouth fr 🤡╰─▸ ❝It was the same thing that would’ve gone through any red-blooded male’s mind. Sex.❞misandry looks good on me and u can't tell me otherwise 🥰╰─▸ ❝Don’t try to humanize me. I’m not a tortured hero from one of your romantic fantasies.❞oh irony, my old friend ╰─▸ ❝I destroy everything beautiful that comes into my life.❞he doesn't have emo boi hours, it's his whole personality fr 🙏🏻╰─▸ ❝You’re about to find out what happens when you invite yourself into the lion’s den.❞i laughed for a good ten minutes at this. ╰─▸ ❝My quickly hardening cock fit perfectly against her ass, like we were tailor-made for each other. ❞he's so poetic, shakespeare has got some fierce competition out here (his #1 competitor will always be miles, the ugly in ""ugly love"" though)i would inc more, but I'm so fucking tired of his shenanigans. also, he has dirt on every single person you could think of, and his only way of getting things done is by making threats. he has connections in the FBI, he knows court judges, he knows British government officials... everybody in a position of authority? he knows them. ana could've gone as far as saying he took his evening tea with king Charles, and late night snacks with the Pope and it really wouldn't have been far-fetched 🥴 now meet, Ava(h): she's gone thru sm near-death experiences, but always manages to see the good in people. and beyond that and her love for photography and her phobia, i really couldn't tell you what her personality is. but I'll let her speak for herself too:╰─▸ ❝I didn’t respond, because how was I supposed to tell the man determined to save me that I didn’t want to be saved?❞and then she wonders why people fuck her over 🤦🏻‍♀️╰─▸ ❝Maybe not the “too fast” part, as Alex Volkov had stolen my heart, bit by bit, over the years, even before I thought I liked him.❞she's so delulu i can't w her╰─▸ ❝I’m not one of those girls who chases after guys who don’t want them❞and yet every time y'all have a fallout, it's you who seeks him out? 🤡even if you zoom real close and try your hardest to see if there's any chemistry between ava and alex, i bet you wouldn't be able to. and I'm a myopic bitch, so it was damn near impossible for me to. the romance if you can even call it that (bec its literally just a bunch of tropes), went from 0 to 100 so fucking fast, it gave me a whiplash. the telling >>>> showing also got on my nerves.the smut was acc underwhelming, but i'm so salty we didn't get any in the epilogue 😔 anyway, the only person i genuinely feel somewhat interested in is jules. i hope joshy doesn't ruin their book a lot for me xx -the cover is atrocious 😭 and i'm probably going to hate this 😭",1
"4","57936251","3.5 ⭐️ ok y’all this shit was actually good, like the plot and romance was actually so enticing. ok so basically the plot is girl MC, Ava falls in love with brothers best friend and brothers best friend is a textbook genius with an IQ of 160 named AlexAlex checks all the boxes tall, brooding, dark haired, god complex, rich af, ect.Tell me why i wanted to slap this mf so hard at some points? literally his brooding-ness was so frustrating at times i’m like BITCH SHUT UP. but don’t get me wrong i’d let this man have his way with me. Ava - (she’s Chinese-American ayyy let’s go east asian rep!) i really liked her characterization and character development in this story. she was kinda annoying in the beginning but baby girl pulled through and faced all her trauma by HERSELF and thanks to no man! queen shit!not gonna lie there were some hella cringe scenes that had me laughing out loud. i was giggling and laughing so mf hard. honestly that’s on me and my twisted sense of humor.i literally cannot wait for the next book because it’s a bodyguard/forbidden romance and i just KNOW it’s gonna top this one. I FUCKING KNOW IT. it comes out july 29th btw",3
"5","57936251","Here me out: Alex kept talking about how Ava won’t be able to handle his “dark side” also referring to sex so I kind of expected him to be into idk maybe BDSM but nooo. He just liked other stuff than the missionary position. I expected more for how dramatic he was about it so I kind of laughed out loud when I read that. I also didn’t really like the way he talked and he would say the most random sexual phrases that made zero sense at that time so I just kept cringing when he talked. Let’s not even talk about that one specific scene… (cough y/n singing this is my fight song). Plot wise I was invested because of Ava’s past and I wanted to know about this fictional world but I didn’t personally vibe with the plot twist. It made sense but also not at all?",1

i started this book because i had fomo. who tf let me??? oh and i also finished this book because a hate review came with it so duh thats a bonusthis book was…. lacking in all kinds of ways and i seriously was just not into it at all. people who like this book have weird brains. im saying that in the nicest way possible… maybe the plot? 
  cliche.
the romance? 
  cringe.
the characters? 
  bland.
the book? 
  A TOTAL DISASTER.
also please remember : CHECK TRIGGER WARNINGS BEFORE READING BUT DONT EVEN BOTHER BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. RUN AWAY !!nothing in this book intrigued me and 99% of it either gave me the icks or made me want to jump into an endless void. yes i hated this book but also yes im finishing the bloody series sigh
  
    PLOT ˎˊ˗
  
ava chen is just a normal college girl who has a protective brother, josh chen. low and behold, joshy has a ”mysterious, bad boy, rich, smart” best friend, alex volkov. ava has a broken past that, oh no she cant just figure out and would you believe it?? so does alex. trauma haunts both of us and so they both turn to each other to basically seek solitude but then realise that will most likely all. go. to. shit. how lovely right?the plot was just so boring to me. it was really cliche and it was so predictable i probably dozed off so many times i can’t remember the story like the plot twist?? not even that amazing and was just like squashed under their romance anyway so i see no point in it tbhin short, wasnt my vibe the beginning was a huge snooze with really nothing going on. plus we then have some crazy bullshit get pulled?? like alex is a full psycho killing stalker maniac and ava still wants him??? spare me the headache PLEASE
  
    ROMANCE ˎˊ˗
  
the romance had me puking on the floor. it was so cringe. so incredibly cringy i was ready to sell my eyes on the black market wtf. maybe the smut wasnt my type of thing?? well thats what i thought BUT its honestly just because its alex volkov doing all those things. if it was anyone else i wouldnt mind i just have an issue with HIM 
  “Get up,” he said, his voice soft but so commanding I obeyed without thinking. “You’re about to find out what happens when you invite yourself into the lion’s den.”
just say youre a furry and move along jeez. how can he say this and ava not be shitting her pants laughing?? again, THE ROMANCE WAS NOT IT. if someone would care to enlighten me on how their romance made any sense. usually i would say ”oh im all ears” no fuck that keep those reasons to yourself <3
  
    CHARACTERS ˎˊ˗
  

  ava chen :
⤷ she was definitely way too trusting which at first i honestly didnt mind and didnt see it was an issue but then when fucking alex volkov is a literal walking red flag and this woman is just like ”oh but i love him and miss him who cares if he killed 2 people and stalked me for a year” like what the fuck??? and her whole ex situation was so random. it was like ”what is the easiest most boring way to add some spice into my story so the male mc can be jealous” type of vibes news flash : cheating psycho ex is no better than moving on to a psycho killing stalker by the end of the book, i was sick of her
  alex volkov :
⤷ i dont hate many male mcs but boy oh boy did this man literally make me want to just throw him a free funeral like wow he’s rich and smart. does that just automatically mean we just forget about all the shit he did?? ITS JUST SO FUCKING UNREALISTIC IDK WHAT ELSE TO SAY yes its a fiction book but like it just didn’t add up. ive read more unrealistic books than this yet they were done so much better?? he gave me the actual icks SO BAD and i really couldnt stand him. the way ava told him that she hated him and didnt want to be involved with him but he would be like ”well too bad youre mine and im gonna wait” like what..?he followed her around FOR A FUCKING YEAR in another fucking country and idk waited for her to forgive him. its the way that he did it that made it 10x creepier and not romantic at all. someone get this man into like those love sessions with a love professional idfkin conclusion, i hate him. he can burn. im too lazy to do each side character because the book isnt good enough for me to put that much effort. 
  
    CONCLUSION ˎˊ˗
  
i hate this book. i wasted my life. i want to go home and sleep but i am home tf am i saying… this book is making me stupid. send help ok bye <3",1

"29","57936251","2.5 - 3 stars.🔹  Overall feelings: 〰 Mmm this is honestly such a hard review to write because this was such a confusing reading experience for me. On one hand, I really liked this book but on the other, I really didn’t. I will try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review so let’s get on with it...🔹  What I liked: ✏ 
  Characters: 
〰 Here’s the thing, I liked the characters, I really did. Both Ava and Alex were loveable and the side characters were also interesting and intriguing. I even liked Bridget and wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was a literal princess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity). ✏ 
  Tropes: 
〰 The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother’s best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.〰 I really liked the fact that Ava’s brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex’s betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules’ book). ✏ 
  Representation: 
〰 We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story. 〰 The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...🔹  What I did not like: ✏ 
  Plot: 
〰 During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava’s father was such a cliché that I was honestly surprised that none of the author’s beta readers had told her to cut out this “plot twist”. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:
  “Michael’s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‘Bravo’. He slow-clapped. ‘I almost had you,’ he told me. ‘You should’ve seen yourself’ I swear, Mrs. James was real,’ he mimicked, laughing.” 
〰 And don’t even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex’s uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyone was shocked by this “turn of events”. ✏ 
  Aspects of the writing style and characterization: 
〰 And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They’ve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it’s about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is. 〰 This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literal year passes in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:
   “Alex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn’t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.” 
〰 Ummm, I’m sorry what? You can’t go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‘Alex and I developed a friendship over the past year’. If you do that then you can’t expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough): 👏  Passage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.  👏 We need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex’s love nor did I believe in Alex’s remorse because I hadn’t been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment. 🔹  Final thoughts: 〰 If you read any of my ‘pre-reading’ updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author’s works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author’s instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing. 〰 Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn’t a horrible read in any way.——————— Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/—————————————————————————-PRE-READING UPDATES: ———————-Ok but I just stalked the author’s instagram and now I’m pretty freaking excited about this😩———————-Mmmm I think I’m intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.",3

Yeah, this was 𝗡𝗢𝗧 that. This book was EVERYTHING. I MEAN 𝑬𝑽𝑬𝑹𝒀𝑻𝑯𝑰𝑵𝑮. I’ve highlighted so much. WAY TOO MUCH 🙆‍♀️I read this so slowly because I knew when it would be over I’d be a wreck. 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗜𝗧 𝗛𝗔𝗦 𝗥𝗨𝗜𝗡𝗘𝗗 𝗠𝗘 𝗙𝗢𝗥 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗥𝗢𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝗕𝗢𝗢𝗞𝗦. My standards are too high now. 🤠The writing was 𝘐𝘔𝘔𝘈𝘊𝘜𝘓𝘈𝘛𝘌． I can go on and on about how beautifully written this masterpiece was. The diversity in this book was amazing to see!There was not a 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗟𝗘 dry page. Not one. I drank every damn page like it was my only source of water.This wasn’t the typical third-act conflict type of book. NOPE. It was riddled with ups and downs but you can’t help but feel everything with these characters. It had depth and was plain amazing till the freaking end. (𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘶𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘳𝘨𝘦𝘰𝘶𝘴)𝗜𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗳𝗳𝘆, 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗮-𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘆. 𝙊𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙥𝙞𝙘𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙂𝙊𝙊𝘿. It had lots of my favourite tropes. The found family trope in here was the cutest shit I’ve read in ages. The communication between the MCs was like a balm to my soul bc after all of the miscommunication tropes, I thoroughly BASKED in it. The small moments guys. 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒.They gave me all the feels. The soft touches. Him randomly tucking her hair behind her ear. Her just staring at him bc he’s so damn hot. The forehead kisses. The way she calls him “bub” 🤭🦋🦋There’s so much more where this came from I promise! 𝗡𝗔𝗧𝗘 𝗛𝗔𝗪𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗦 is my newly anointed HUSBAND from sports romance. This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny. But their banter is even better 🤌❤️‍🔥He actually had his own life in this book too. Sometimes dual povs just feel like one because they’re both living the same thing. But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain. Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things. I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered. I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!! Whew!

"32","61767292","To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn’t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time. We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn). As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that. The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny. Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.",1
"33","61767292","Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?  ""stop slapping your balls this loud""   ""her ass smells so good""  ""can Lola really hear my balls?""   Yes, these are all quotes from this book.  Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who's hooking up with who, how many kinky things they've done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they're having sex.  The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING: oh, it wasn't his fault, he doesn't know a lot about pregnancy. he's a good guy, he's just a 25 year old MAN who doesn't understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.   But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it's just a wattpad book that hasn't been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.   There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.  It's not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish. I JUST don't get it.  I am a geriatric millennial.",1
"34","61767292","FUCK THIS BOOK AND EVERYBODY IN ITTTTT. Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan. THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink. FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS? Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD. And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”! (Stfu!!! No Consent is no consent!)) and 2) they fuck literally a couple days after even though she’s drunk AGAIN. SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT SHIT. Yeah this is garbo ok bye LOVEU.",1
"35","61767292","4.3 ⭐️ it should’ve been me… to start off, i folded throughout this entire book. it’s always the nice guys with dirty mouths that get me in heat. and i know i’m gonna die alone at this point because i will accept nothing less than nathan hawkins….anyways….um the plot…where was it? lmaooo nah but fr why tf was this book so goddamn long. don’t get me wrong the filler was actually good. like i kinda enjoyed reading about them just being a couple and doing couply things. lowkey wish they didn’t get together so soon but whatever. and half the time i couldn’t distinguish between the side characters so whenever they’d say something i kinda just tuned out. unless it was what they texted in the group chat. that was actually funny and worthwhile 😂 aaron can fall into a volcano for all i care tho.Anastasia…your honor i love her. i enjoyed reading about her character growth and development. she’s a 10/10 baddie i gotta say because when she did the splits on Nathan’s dick…why tf was i breathing heavy? the things she’d say to make him blush???…bruh we were both blushing. i appreciated how she always said things straight. point blank period. there’s literally no miscommunication when miss girl is around and i admire that. she’s also way better than me for putting up with Aaron uglyass Carlisle because i would’ve pounded that pricks head into the fucking ice if someone spoke to me like that. Nathan Hawkins…ok i hate to admit it but this mf was really holding this book together. there’s something about a guy willing to get down on his knees for you in a second that’s just so poetic. and god damn the mouth on this man had me tearing my pillow in half. the fucking praise 😩😩😩 the way he so unconditionally loves Anastasia was so lyrical. and oooh when he saved Anastasia from almost drowning…your honor, is it problematic it that i found that kinda attractive?? hmmm 🧐 in conclusion, if he ain’t nathan hawkins… get the fuck outta my face",4
"36","61767292","I fell for the cute cover and the figure skater x hockey player trope, but honestly this was so NOT good for me. I liked Nathan –the hero–, because he was sweet, caring and understanding, while also being charming and a little bit cocky, but I guess that's it? 1. I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before. 2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly. 3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN. I heard this was a Wattpad story before and maybe that's why the whole plot feels a bit cut off, but gosh, a new conflict after a few chapters? It was a few conflicts too much. I can't even remember how many acts this book had because they felt endless to me.",2

  if you are going to make a book that is sex driven at least make the smut good.

  ”You are the most annoying man I’ve ever met.””I don’t care what you call me as long as I’m top of the list.”“You have no idea, do you? The lengths I’d go to if you’d let me. What I’d do to make you happy.””In a world where I feel like I could be swept away by the waves at any moment, he anchors me. I value that, value him.”“You’re worth defending. Every cut, bruise, every single pang of anger or frustration. It’s all worth it. I’d throw my last punch defending you because you deserve to have someone be that person for you, and there’s no one more qualified for the job than me.”
i’m embarrassed to say i was excited to read this book. am i being dramatic? maybe. but listen: i genuinely tried liking this book. i put up with the boring first few chapters. but wow!! all of a sudden it picks up! is that supposed to make me like it more? who knows. from the very beginning, i didn’t like the main character that much. she gave me pick me vibes and it’s clear the author tries to make her different from other fmc’s. while i appreciate this effort, i could not bring myself to like her.one thing i did like? ryan!! they had a dynamic that i loved and they cared abt each other in a way that wasn’t overbearing. not to mention the way anastasia was supportive of his relationship with olivia! i have to admit it was a nice change and it was completely understandable. i found his character to be so sweet and i wish we got more of his and anastasia’s friendship. i also liked sasha & anastasia’s friendship despite the embarrassing things that happened when they first met. i am never getting over it.
  “I’m going to teach you how to be nice.”“I’m sure there are plenty of things you can teach me, Nathan, but being nice isn’t one of them. I’m a delight.”
my main problem with the main character: she tried too hard to be grumpy. she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that. i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!
  “It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”
—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s just sex driven.overall, this book was so slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.
  “I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”
mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remained boring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants
  “He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”
i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where i WANTED a third act conflict. i usually hate them but they needed it!! he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point. not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman! spoilers from this point on
  “You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”
these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy. i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.
  “There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”
speaking of the boys: i don’t see why people like henry. he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months. 3 MONTHS. i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them. the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him. i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works but not in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedˏˋ°•*⁀➷icebreaker - 1.75 starswildfire - tbrdaydream - tbr
  pre-review
i had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc",1
"55","61767292","I don’t understand how people can rate this book with 4 or 5 stars. I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again. It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy. The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness. This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.",1

"58","61767292","Can we take a moment and talk about the real star of the book?✨Henry✨He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn't give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget : "" it was fun staying in Henry's room.

Thank you wanker cowboy, you’re dismissed.To everyone who said it was great, I hope you will forgive me but I found this book cringy and boring… I couldn’t care less about the supposedly sexy cowboy with a ponytail (a ponytail! It’s 2023! Maybe a mustache too?!) and his princess. Their chemistry was nonexistent and the guy was annoying and disgusting. He didn’t even know her yet and he was already having an inner monologue about her ‘cherry lips’ around his cock 🤢. And I really did not need to be notified every time he ‘fucked his hand’. Then there’s the father of our twenty five year old  heroine, calling her princess(!) in a professional environment(!!) and telling her who is and who is not allowed into her pants(!!!). If it was a joke I didn’t laugh. I’m done (because if this were my last moment alive I would not want to waste it on this book 🤡)I know they will bang eventually, so what will the daddy do?

"61","60755618","I didn't know I needed a cowboy romance in my life, but I NEEDED a cowboy romance in my life. It was so fun exploring the world of bull riding and grumpy cowboy brothers. I also LOVED all the side characters like Willa, Theo, and the whole Eaton family. This book also had so much heart, especially towards the end. Summer has a complicated and messy family past, and Rhett has his own issues surrounding his identity with bull riding. I loved how full the whole world of this book felt since we get to experience so much of Rhett and Summer's love story but also both of their individual stories, families, and friends. Can't wait for book 2! I know Cade is going to melt my heart.",5

Thank youUgh ok, I don't even know how to start this, exhale air and rub eyes, OK NOT MORE EXCUSES!! LET'S GO.I am very disappointed with this book, I expected a lot more, I picked up this book thinking it was going to be a cute cowboy small town romance, and guess what? It was boring, mostly predictable and very very very cringey. Will I read the rest of the books in the series? Yes, mainly because I am a masochist and I like to suffer, and also because I am interested in reading the stories of Cade, Winter and Jasper hehe. So, this was a bad book, but the cover is pretty… right? Eye twicht.
  ↳˗ˏˋ𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝ˊˎ˗ ↴:
Our main girl is Summer Hamilton, daughter of Kip Hamilton, who is Rhett Eaton's agent, professional bull rider and our main guy. Rhett has made some controversial comments that have caused several sponsors to withdraw their sponsorship, so Kip assigns Rhett a “babysitter”, Summer, to watch over him and stop him from doing stupid things.
  ↳˗ˏˋ𝚙𝚊𝚌𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚠𝚛𝚒𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐ˊˎ˗ ↴:
The book is boring, it took me 5 days to finish it, because every time I finished a chapter, I saw how many pages the next one had, I sighed and closed the book, I picked up my phone and that's how the hours passed. The author's writing hasn't convinced me either, I haven't managed to connect with any character, she kept repeating how Summer was a people pleaser but she didn't show it, or how Rhett was very closed off with everyone but he literally was so social? ?? SHOW ME INSTEAD OF TELLING ME!! UGH. The author tried to include a sense of humor but failed miserably, she literally called the main character Summer and her sister Winter, I think nothing else need to be said. And don't get me started on smut.I will talk very explicitly about the smut here, so if you are uncomfortable with that feel free to skip to the character section: Ok you know what? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SMUT. BECAUSE I WANTED TO SUMERGE MY EYES ON BLEACH EVERY. FUCKING. SCENE.The saddest thing about all this is that the characters didn't do anything excessively wild, and let's be mature, almost everyone has sex, so we are not going to get scandalized because some dick sucking or eating pussy, but it's the way the author described It that made it so unbearable to read.I also have to remember that Rhett masturbated continuously, LIKE, HOMMIE, PLS. In the first chapter of his point of view he literally says “I want to arrive home and have a date with my own hand” SIR. TMI. I don't mind the masturbation scenes because I am a person who is very open sexually, few things shock or bother me, but there were too many and his dick was hardening ALL THE TIME. LIKE FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS SITUATIONS. It's not that there are many chapters that contain smut, but the number of times the characters mention and think with their genitals makes it feel like there is much more spicy content than there really is.
  ↳˗ˏˋ𝚌𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚜 ˊˎ˗ ↴:
sᴜᴍᴍᴇʀ ʜᴀᴍɪʟᴛᴏɴ: I HATE HER. Supposedly, Summer is a city girl, I say supposedly because by the fifth chapter she is already more than integrated into the town, even though she wears skirts because she is not like the other girls, obviously. She has the same sense of humor as a brick, and the amount of second hand embarrassment she caused me throughout the book should be a crime.“Because its only day one, and Im already going to be called upon to help Little Rhett in his pants” (Literally shut the fuck up)“Okay, macho man” (Someone please sedate her)“But giving me the last piece is just so… sweet. I almost can't reconcile it. “I almost want to ask myself what it means” (GIRL, IT’S CHICKEN DRUMSTICK, RELAX)Something that bothered me a lot about her is the amount of toxic ideas she has about what masculinity is, she explicitly says that Rhett's hands are masculine because they are calloused and not soft, like those of other boys in her city, that some even liked to get manicures. Or that only Rhett could make jewelry look masculine, jewelry is genderless, stupid retrograde and sexist bitch.“Only Rhett Eaton could make jewelry so damn manly” (??? This is why you don't have friends, Summer)You can tell I didn't like her at all. I hated how she believed that she was not Rhett's priority because despite being dangerous, he continued doing bull riding, girl, it's his passion, I perfectly understood why Rhett didn't want to leave it.ʀʜᴇᴛᴛ ᴇᴀᴛᴏɴ: I think for the first time in history, I like the boy more than the girl, even though Rhett was more boring than staring at a wall, his only personality trait was being a bull rider, and that's it. Sometimes a grumpy one. I did really like his interactions with his brothers, and I have little else to say about him, he was that boring.“One is the real me, the other is just for show. The problem is, not very many people know the real me anymore” (BORING AND CLICHÉ)- I didn't really care about the rest of the characters, Cade was an ass and Winter was a bitch, but I'm excited to read their povs on the next books and see their reaons for being like that. And Jasper was a sweetheart but we didn't get much of him, so I can't say much more.

I really enjoyed the concept of Rhett being a bit of a troublesome bad boy who's gotten himself in some trouble, which cost him his reputation and some sponsors. And Summer who comes in to keep him in line.I've never read about a bull rider before, so who knew I would love him so much?

Summer was SO lovable. I enjoyed her character sm. the way she’s been done so dirty her entire life but still managed to turn out an optimist makes me love her even more. The strength in softhearted women is criminally underrated. Funnily enough, the connection between the MCs, before the third act breakup, was more than enough to make up for the fact that they got back together literally pages- PAGES before the epilogue. Their reunion was believable — well… as believable as corny romance books can get — for it to work out bc I could see they would last. This is so rare for me so ofc I have to give an extra half star 🥹As for the men’s ranking from most interested to least interested in reading their book:1. Beau — I’m being told this is an unpopular opinion?? Whyyy! He’s literally got me in the tightest chokehold and he’s hardly been present most of the book. Him putting on a dumb facade but in reality being the smartest in the room?? The golden retriever energy?? I’m so freaking tempted to skip all the books to get to his story 🙏 I just know his book is GNA eat. 2. Cade — ofc ofcccc I want to read his book asap- like him stepping up as the parent figure when the parent checked out??? Grumpy surly burly single dad with a cheery sunshine pookie to call his own??? I was his from the first time he spoke, taking the piss out of Rhett. legit at line one and I’m outtttt- HEARTBEAT FLATLINED 🫦3. Theo — cheery carefree bull rider and uptight ice queen surgeon??? Watch me enter the biggest slump of my life when I read their book 😝🤞🤞🤞4. Jasper — listen he reminds me of one of my favvvv characters ever, so naturally I want him too. The cutthroat dgaf attitude?? The almost detached but still teasing personality? I’m ferallll- so tempted to look up who his love interest is but I don’t wanna spoil it for myself (yes I consider this a spoiler pls let me be 🤚) I think I’ve covered them all? Yep. Well that’s my order of interest at this moment in time. But I’m def sure it’ll change. I’ll probs do a list of fav to least in my last review of this series.

I was worried that the initial intense feelings I had for this book were a fluke. But they weren’t. 😭I fell in love with this story all over again. This instalment in the series feels severely underrated to me. Unpopular opinion: I’m pretty sure I prefer it to Heartless. Possibly. 👀I loved every moment of this reread. ————————————

So, I’m about to become obsessed with this series! 😍I could not escape the hype for this one and I finally just had to cave and read it. And oh my lord. This was pure fun! It made me happy! These two characters had so much heart and playfulness between them that I was on the verge of losing it several times. Because feelings. 🥹The hype was very much worth it and I can’t wait to continue on with the series. We were introduced to such a great bunch of characters and I love that they all felt as relevant as our main ones. Also, I gotta shoutout the dads in this book. Kip and Harvey were just the most precious, most adoring kind. But, the book isn’t without its flaws. The minor gripe I had was the way the conflict(s) was handled. I mean, emotions were rife and whatnot but it somewhat dragged for me. And I wish certain elements that surrounded the conflicts were expanded upon more. But other than that, I cannot fault this book. 4.5 ⭐️Buddy-read with Sara! 🥰",5

Didn’t like the writing quite as much as Lucy score herself, but it was very similar and I still enjoyed this read! The characters were easy to love, although rhetts oldest brother, Cade maybe??? honestly can’t remember, bro he irked me occasionally, just not my type of guy but I know he has his own trauma which I can’t wait to read about when his book comes out so I can stop being annoyed by the comments he made. Bro FUCK summers half sister and step mom. OH AND ROB. I love the way Rhett defended her even though she didn’t want it and saw it as a lack of trust…honestly in the moment I probably would have too. I really loved the text messages at the beginning of each chapter….they actually made me laugh out loud. The dialogue between the characters in the text were exactly how I talk so I was CHUCKLING.",4

 okay i first want to say i kind of love seeing book titles actually being mentioned in the book, even if it is so dumb. it just does something to my brain 🤸🏽‍♀️now i feel like me giving this book a 2-star rating is me being incredibly generous cause at most this book was average as hell. like okay i can see why a lot of people have loved this book but sadly i could not be one of those people, im sorry i know i make myself miserable by not enjoying things everyone else does sometimes. summer hamiltion graduated from law school... are we hearing this? LAW SCHOOL. and you know what her first job is? to babysit a 32-year-old man bc he can't stfu and keep his d in his pants 😐 at this moment i just KNEW i was going to have a hard time enjoying this 😣 i will admit i enjoyed the first 200 pages, but after that, it was CONSTANTLY either rhett talking about summer and her curves and whatnot, and then summer would only use words relating to masculinity to describe rhett. and summer was just a PUSH-OVER, she cared too much about what others thought. 🙂 i swear at the beginning of the book she seemed strong but when rhett came into the picture she thrived off of validation from him. it was just too painful. now rhett, was so annoying. 16 year old boy trapped in the body of a 32 year old and i mean that in the most insulting way ever. i swear everytime cade (his brother) chewed him out i was cheering. but he literally was just an ick. long hair? ew. putting it into a PONYTAIL? double ew. im trying not to think too deeply about this book because i might get more annoyed than i already am 😐 but anyway, i can't wait for cade's book because he knows what responsibilities are and i liked him every time he knocked some sense into rhett. i will say the ending kind of did have me blushing a little 🫣 so yes im aware im part of the problem. but i would recommend this to anyone who just wants a cowboy romance and does not want to think AT ALL, like brain is empty af. so overall, the first 200 pages were tolerable. everything is the middle made me want to gauge my eyes out and the ending somewhat was cliche but not in the way i expected 🫡chestnut springs series rating: 3 stars 1. flawless ~ 2 stars2.  heartless  ~ 3.5 stars 3. powerless  ~  4 stars 4. reckless  ~  4.5 stars 5. hopeless  ~ 1 star ———sometimes all i want is an empty brain and a dumb lil cowboy romance",2

Flawless is my new favorite Elsie Silver book! This is the first book in Silver's new 'Chestnut Springs' series and I'm here for all the potential books in this one! Especially if we get more of those Eaton boys! Rhett Eaton is a bull rider who got in a bit of trouble with his sponsors. While his agent is trying to smooth things over, Rhett gets a... babysitter for the last few months of his tour. This babysitter happens to be Summer Hamilton, his agent's daughter. Summer is working at her dad's firm and is willing to do whatever it takes to prove herself. She's a bit of a people pleaser and definitely a relatable character. The banter in this book was... chef's kiss perfect. And the chemistry between these two was insane. At first, you could tell Rhett didn't want Summer around. He thought he didn't need her or any help, but how wrong he was. And Summer needed someone like Rhett. Someone who had her back and was there for her no matter what. I truly loved these two together. They had a spark from the moment they first met and they became combustible. Not only did I love them, but Summer's dad was amazing. I also loved Rhett's dad and his entire family. I want a Beau book, a Clay book, and a Jasper book! This was such a fantastic read and I'm looking forward to reading more from this world.",5
"79","60755618","— 2.5 stars ☆this was sweet. 🥰 but the fact that cade stole the show for me should say a lot <3 to Rhett - you managed to make hating milk a whole-ass personality trait, amazing job!! (i hate milk as well, so that's one thing we have in common and the only thing. thank god for small mercies that i don't own a ranch)to Summer - plsss, you were a lil interesting but i literally. have. zero. highlights. in this book. and that should say a lot to you, madam.basically all in all this was a very meh read, i guess it could be called cute as well? but nothing very remarkable or anything. fluffy, all that, but i couldn't feel the characters at all. in the first 30% i thought this had SO MUCH POTENTIAL 😭 - you should see how my hopes died after Rhett and Summer survived miscommunication, the one-bed trope, the dreaded hospital scene, and ofc the very clichéd ex of Summer (who very obviously marries her sister). I SKIMMED THE SEX SCENES. 💀 yep. sorry to admit this, but i didn't realise what went where into which part in this book 😭 it was that bad. plus the dirty talk was very ehh. buddy read this with lia, lil tangerine and leni! <3",2

Finally entered my cowboy era with this series 🤠 i was looking for something that would give me silly and fun feels and this was perfect and a total pallet cleanser from my usual reads. some of the vibes were cute when they weren’t cheesy but I enjoyed the easiness of it nonetheless and some laughs (which is clear by how fast I read this). “You wear the hat, you ride the cowboy”Summer & Rhett had some sweet moments especially that epilogue that felt swoony and individually had their own things to work on which kinda felt more telling than showing but the message still ultimately got across. I don’t have much to say about these two. I found summer to be sweet but she needed to stand her ground more with others. Now Rhett, he was in fact the more childish out of his brothers yet aware of it and surely had some growing up to do which he managed but I know his character left little to be desired mostly for some. However, I did enjoy him riling summer up 😂 and milk haters = Rhett and me lol This seemed like an ok start to the series and the inclusion of all the characters here really sets the tone for the next books. I’m now jumping into heartless next as I need more of Willa’s humor and want to see which Eaton brother is my fav besides who else could win me over as I enjoyed the interactions between them all! 3.5 stars“What are binary stars?” His finger tenderly swipes across the spot he’s talking about. “It’s two stars that look like one to us when we see them in the sky. But really, they’re two. Stuck together by a gravitational pull, always orbiting one another.” “Kind of like the two of us, stuck together,” he muses.”“He’s connected the freckles to say Mine. And God, in this moment, I feel like that might be true.”",3

"82","60755618","|| 2.0 stars ||Honestly, I did kind of like the tension and the chemistry between them at the beginning, but after they had sex for the first time it all became super bland. And it’s not even like there were only sex scenes after that, but it’s just that I didn’t get a deeply romantic vibe from them. Luckily it did take them a while to get to the sex stage, but once it did, I was super bored and I lost all investment in their relationship. It suddenly felt a lot more superficial and forced, and they just didn’t interest me whatsoever.Also, I really struggled with the tone of this book sometimes; it’s like nobody was ever capable of having a real, genuine conversation with meaningful emotions. Like, for example, when her dad finds out she’s been groomed as a teen by her doctor and sister’s husband, he just… jokes about it? And doesn’t mention it again?? Nobody takes it as seriously as you’d expect and that really threw me off. Weird situations where serious topics are brushed aside like that happened quite often in this book and it made it pretty hard for me to feel connected to the story or the characters. It made everything seem pretty lame and silly.Furthermore, I kind of hated how Summer let everyone walk all over her. I know she’s supposed to be this sweetheart with a giant heart, and I do like her because of that, but it also really frustrated me when she was so forgiving towards people who genuinely treated her like trash.Lastly, Rhett truly behaved like a child 99% of the time. He could be pretty gentle and galant towards Summer, so I didn’t hate him or anything like that, but he was just so childish and petulant that I honestly couldn’t respect him. It’s like Rhett’s one goal in life was to be as stubborn as he possibly could. He also never really took other people’s feelings into consideration, and it made him seem so immature. This dude was literally destroying his own body for no reason; he was doing it just because he was so damn desperate for attention. Thus, like I said, I simply couldn’t respect him.All in all, this was a disappointing and lackluster read for me. It wasn’t terrible, but it was just super underwhelming.

The writing felt fresh and funny, the two main characters seem to have the right spark to turn a workplace, can't-stand-your-lousy-ass type of thing into a full on spicy romance deal. Up until 30% of it, I was truly convinced I'd end up loving this to pieces. The quote I put at the start of my review is actual proof that this had potential to be as fluffy and enjoyable as I was promised it'd be.I was enamored with the relationship Summer and Rhett both had with their dads (and with his brothers, in his case) and the way they seemed to gravitate around each other, despite their differences. Alas, on a very sad wednesday, I took a second look at the cover and realized the guy on it has very very very long hair, and everything went downhill from it. I'm kidding, obviously. I'm picky, but not so picky to downgrade a book or a book character by their hair lenght, but it seemed to be the catalyst moment that turned this book into an epic fiasco. For one, the relationship between Summer and Rhett had no progression. Their ""friendship"" bloomed out of nowhere, which left no space for a real and deep bond to truly form; I found it a little too conventient to play on a will they won't they level when it was clear they were both pretty taken, at some point. The whole DTR shit is for the teens, not for people who throw around heavy words only to play them off as a lust-fueled experience. Rhett went from sexy, easy going cowboy with a milk adversion to a full possessive asshole who was so immature I had to keep reminding myself he was my age and not a hormonal teenager. I couldn't stand the smut in this book. Sum and Rhett's first time felt so forced and so approximate it gave me no emotion. I didn't feel their compatibility AT ALL, didn't get into it, and actually felt embarassed most of the time. I think even 50 Shades was better in that field, at this point, and I despise that trilogy. But most of all, I hated how Rhett basically gave a Summer a job interview via dirty talk. Only because you're using dirty words, it doesn't mean it's gonna do the trick. Every line that comes out of Rhett's mouth after that was so cheesy it was basically a fondue dinner for 20 people. Everything he said felt scripted and I couldn't tell if the author was trying to make the book quotable of it was her actual idea of how romance should sound. And his personality. Jesus Christ...WHY. WHY????? He had so much potential. “Woman, I’m wiping you with a hot washcloth after sex. That’s how much I love you.”This should give you an idea of how low standards were held. Sorry if it makes you wanna throw up. I felt the same way and Leni kindly offered to hold back my hair while I did. THAT, RHETT, IS WHAT LOVE SOUNDS LIKE. Cue, the hospital scene that made me drop the three stars I was going to give this to the two pityful ones I decided for in the end. No, just no. Possessiveness only works in certain situations and that one absolutely wasn't the case. Summer is okay, if not a little bland, but I admired her passion for her work. And I love her dad soooo much. I actually think Summer and Rhett's little text exchanges with Kip were my favorite thing about the entire book.Although, yeah, even I have to admit the whole friendly father thing was very unrealistic and VERY over the top. This is definitely not how I imagined this review to go, but I can't bring myself to give this the praise it doesn't deserve. Cowboy my ass. I'm gonna go drown myself in a dark and dirty mafia romance to wash off the cheese. 🌻🌻🌻🌻Buddy read this with the coolest ladies on GR (my  Lila Sunshine, my Darling Tangerine, and my beautiful Baby Otter).😏We are cute...but we read naughty books!😏 #2",2

"85","60755618","""You are not a burden. You are not a waste of time. You are very wanted. And anyone who makes you feel you're anything less deserves Rhett Eaton's fist to their face."" Forget cowboys, I now specifically want one who is also a professional bull-rider. Yes, this is only my second cowboy romance book and my tastes are already growing more specific. Or maybe my inner Scarlett O'Hara just can't resist a man named RHETT who has that same rugged, untamable Rhett Butler attitude of not giving a damn about what anyone else thinks. This book's Rhett (Eaton), resident pro bull-rider, fist-fighter, and sex symbol extraordinaire, doesn't care whatsoever about the opinions of others. It's endearing and reckless and admirable and powerful. It also serves as a foil to our externally uptight FMC, Summer, a lawyer fresh out of law school who doesn't  really  know what she wants from life because she's trained herself to do what she thinks others want her to do. Essentially, Summer needs some of Rhett Eaton's ""frankly my dear I don't give a damn"" attitude, and Rhett needs a little more of Summer's sturdiness. Summer's tasked with Rhett Eaton babysitting duty (hello opposites attract, enemies to lovers, forced proximity, only one bed tropes!) to keep him on the straight and narrow. She moves onto his family's ranch in Chestnut Springs and spicy conflict arises. Think: secret nighttime rendevouzs in an old pickup truck beneath the stars, breakfasts with the Eaton boys, dancing at the local western bar, chaps and whipped cream and body shots and feral cowboy possessiveness. Fortunately for the sanity of the modern day romance reader, Summer is no Scarlett O'Hara and there is the happiest of happy endings and the sweetest epilogue to boot. ❤️‍🔥🐂🤠🤍🙌🏽🌄Flawless is one of those books you just speed through without ever feeling bored. It's slow burn but not slow burn to the point where you're just begging for something to happen. Its super well done! There is depth, excitement, action (both on and off of bulls), love, spice, and so much character growth. It’s also funny at times (the entire milk sponsorship thing made me lol) and the bantering is great. There's a quote somewhere that says something about Summer smoothing Rhett's hard edges and Rhett scuffing her up a bit, and that's exactly what their relationship is like. They balance each other while supporting one another to move beyond their comfort zones and fight for the lives that they want, not the lives that others want for them. And can we talk about Kip Hamilton, Summer's dad and Rhett's agent, who is THE REAL MVP of this book?! Such a conniving little matchmaker with so much depth of his own. Dad of the year to that guy in so many ways. ONTO THE NEXT BOOK. I know already I'm going to binge this series and be left a shell of my former self at the end. Anyways goodbye Rhett (*pours a shot of whiskey and cries*) but HELLO Cade Eaton!",4

  ”Welcome to the wild side, Princess.""
It's official...I am making this book/series my entire personality and I am not sorry for the person I become.I was absolutely enamored with everything about this book. The characters, the plot, the writing, the setting, everything. I can't remember the last time I giggled and laughed so much at a book. This made me feel so warm and fuzzy and made my heart feel so full. I was LIVING for the spice. Elsie you truly have done it, ma'am. I cried, I laughed, I was kicking my feet, I was angry. I channeled every emotion while reading this book. This was also really fast-paced but not in the weird insta-lovey way, but the overall plot moved fast and it played out really well for the timing of the book and it's events. Forewarning...there is a third-act breakup. Yes, it was stupid and yes, it was unnecessary. However, the book itself was so beyond good that I didn't mind it all too much. I wasn't happy with it, but it's there so what can you do? 🙃 There is also a one bed trope and a ”she’s off limits” trope  which I absolutely DEVOURED. 🤭
  ”I don't want it, Rhett. I want you. I'm tired of doing what I should and ignoring what I want. And what I want is you. Inside me. All around me. I want you with me. And I want to be the only one.""
Summer and Rhett are the perfect couple and their chemistry was off. the. charts! OFF THE CHARTS! The tension, the banter, everything about them was just so...perfect. I honestly could not read this in public because I could not contain my reactions to their conversations. I tried and failed. Summer's character development throughout this book was okay it wasn't amazing, but I still loved her character nonetheless. Rhett's protectiveness was just so *chefs kiss*. I need me a cowboy. 🤠🩷Overall, this book is such a perfect introduction to the Chestnut Springs universe and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series!! You have convinced me...I am forever changed. 😔🤚🏼~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Entering my cowboy romance era after swearing this would never be for me...when I tell you I have been thinking about this book for WEEKS 🤠🩷",5

"90","60060431","Be warned, if you love this book,  do not read this review. I am not showing it any mercy.  To say I had massive expectations is an understatement. I jumped into this knowing I was getting into a romcom. I was waiting for people we meet on vacation feels or Wall of Winnipeg swoons and I got a big pile of the most obnoxious, insufferable writing and plot devices I've seen in a looooong time.  This author managed to write the same book twice... inside of the same book. Does that make sense? Let's start with the fact that this was nearly 700 pages long and every time the main character POUTED because she needed caffeine, I wanted to live a little less.  I need to be fair... Some of the sex scenes were sweet, and this couple could have been cute. This book just had to be AT LEAST 300 pages shorter and the characters had to have a personality and the maturity of a normal human being and not sound like they were all 12. I don't think that is too much to ask, honestly.  This book managed to include every single thing I hate in romcoms, every-single-thing.  Leaving the EXTREMELY obnoxious, forced and stereotypical gay representation in this aside... Let's start with the fact that some authors just go overboard with their ""sunshine"" characters. Why does every sunshine woman need to be co-dependent? Why can't you write a NORMAL bubbly woman, who knows how to be a functional adult?  Nooooooo, but that's not stereotypical enough. A sunshine character is quirky!!! She loves coffee! She can't remember where she parked her car! She is so entertaining!! Did I mention she LOOOOOOOOOOVES coffee? Oh I didn't? Don't worry, the author will make her groan and pout 22 times while she's thinking about coffee before chapter 10, and that is just soooooooooo sexy.  We need to be done with the idea that bubbly women are stupid and helpless women. I can't relate to female characters like that. Have you ever met a woman? In what world would a woman not know what to do in a crisis situation?!  She cries to a complete stranger and asks him:  please, help me, what should I do?  5 times in the first two chapters. The fact that a 40 year old man finds a broken shell of a woman attractive is a red flag of its own.  There are so many things that annoyed the fuck out of me in this book, none of this plot made sense. None of this was down-to-earth, realistic, everything felt forced, all the jokes and the stereotyping were taken to a MAXIMUM.  Oh Julia, but it's fiction. Give it a rest. I have a list of romantic comedies with sunshine and grumpy characters that were written like a damn masterpiece. This one is just bad, I am sorry.  How do you expect me to find their childish bickering from chapter 1 attractive and sexy? The most mature character in this entire book was an 11 year old.   Honorable mentions to: ""I knew you'd have a ""fuck me body"" sentence that came out of our hero's mouth at some point during their first time.   She filled 700 pages with the same back and forth, multiple times, and I think 300 of those pages were inner dialogues of Knox being the most pathetic 40 year old I have ever met and our female lead thinking about coffee, orgasms or having chats with her gay best friend who knows everythinggggg about hair!!  Spare me.   This could have been an ok, sweet story if she just had dialed it down a notch, had not repeated herself 300 times and written normal, down-to-earth characters.  I am honestly annoyed at the misrepresentation of gay characters. I am sick of bubbly women being portrayed as stupid and helpless, I am sick of men's lack of emotional responsibility and maturity being down-played, forgiven easily and used as a plot device. (And I am a dark romance reader so that’s saying something)  This was a bad, boring, over-the-top stupid, over-hyped book.  Sorry, that is my brutally honest review.   It's ok if you liked this book. On a good day I can kind of see why, I feel bad for it, honestly. It just compiled every single thing I hate in romcoms  and threw it at me and I am pissed at it lol, so yeah, two PITY stars.  I did also hate  it happened one summer , another popular and loved book that people compare to this one a lot. Keep that in mind and take it with a grain a salt, this book might be for you!

"92","60060431","I GENUINELY CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS BOOK?!?!?!!?Nearly two weeks after reading the book am I now writing the review and it’s safe to say I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I’M NOT EVEN KIDDING. I’m itching to pick up the book and flip through my tabbed pages and there’s A LOTTTTT. My guess would be over 150 tabs?!? Idk, give or take 🤷‍♀️This book came at a time where I was waiting for the next book to WOWWWW me, and mannnnn, did this not disappoint. I was hooked from the START!!!It’s always a struggle for me to start a book because there’s always that lull at the beginning when you’re getting to know the characters before you get invested, but I was into this from the START. And that’s how I usually know I’ll love the book, is when I’m invested by the end of the first chapter or the first few.IT IS SO FUCKING GOOD!! It’s grumpy sunshine, small romance, she finds out she has a niece she never knew while she has to waltz in and clean up her twin sister’s mess. FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU GET TO SEE HOW GRUMPY KNOX MORGAN IS. This man is soooooooo fucking hot oh my god, I can’t even write this sentence without feeling giddy and wanting to squeal!!I’m so in love with him, I fell in love with every single one of the characters, LITERALLY EVERY ONE (except a big fuck you to Tina), and the story just grips you from beginning to end.There is one particular character I instantly knew I needed a book from and that’s my baby Lucian!! The small snippets you see of him in this book is going to make you fall and fall hard. I hadn’t even finished the book at the time when I decided that he was gonna be my next obsession. (Ofc he’s gonna come second to Mr. Bearded Badboy Grumpy Knox Morgan because that man is everythiiiing)^ here’s how I picture Knox… you know that guy on TikTok with the axe who breaks apart those tree trunks??? THAT MAN???? In my head, that’s him 🤪 (If you don’t like fan casting, then just forget I said anything 😐)I thought I was deluding myself when I finished this book?! I thought to myself, “did I really love this??? Or was this just the first book I got excited for in what feels like a while??”NOPEEEEE. Two things can be true. It was the first book that left me feeling so excited AND I really loved it.There is a happily ever after, and not only do we get one epilogue, BUT ALSO A BONUS EPILOGUE. Seriously, in that bonus epilogue?!?!? With Way and Knox and the way they spoke to each other?! OH MY GOD MY HEART EXPLODED!!When I finish a book, I’m usually at a loss for how to review it especially when it’s been a while since I finished it, but I think this is one of my fastest written reviews lmaooooo. I just really loved this book and highly highly recommend it.It’s a pretty long book, about 500-600 pages (can’t remember) but it didn’t read that long to me at all. I got through it so quickly. I couldn’t put it down.There are just so many good parts in this book that I genuinely head-over-heels enjoyed. How grumpy this man is, the support he gives Naomi, the love and encouragement and pep talks he gave Way. UGH!!! ❤️‍🔥 I wanna read it again byeeee",5
"93","60060431","This is a story about a nice woman who gets into an abusive relationship, and the author calls it romance. I've read a lot of rom-coms, and this book is neither rom nor com. I don't understand how a man who ignores your wishes and opinions, belittles you, dismisses you, takes away your agency, physically grabs you and drags you around, intervenes in your business when he's not wanted, is controlling, is financially and emotionally abusive, snarls, growls, and uses his physicality to intimidate you is in ANY way a romantic lead. The number of strong reviews for this book and positive views of the main male character is truly disturbing. I mean, he even renames her! Her name isn't even good enough. I fully expected Naomi to be buried in a ditch by the end of the book. But I couldn't stand it, so DNF.",1

I really appreciated how he's got his own demons that weren't instantly solved but took time for him to really change. Plus Naomi and her relationship with Waylay made my heart melt.

"104","60060431","– 3.5 starsMe reading approx. 17% of this book: *looks at the ratings* Oh well, another one bites the dust. With an avg. rating of 4.72 it seems like I’m going to be the odd one again who can’t rate this more than 2.5 stars maxMe right after finishing Things We Never Got Over: 🤡 I think I’m going to rate this 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 stars 🤡, cause the book was cute after all and had a tons of tropes done well such as ☀️ sunshine runaway bride & grumpy bad boy barber/business owner🐶 a cute dog👵 a cool grandma👩‍👧 a newly single - mum who had guardianship of her 11 year old niece temporary, cause her twin sister stole her car, left town and left her daughter with her🧠 smart & funny kid🏡 small town vibes a.k.a tons of gossip & meddling folks🏠 forced proximity (mcs are neighbors)🍹 boss / employee💑 very supportive and loving parents from the heroine’s side💖 heroine has the best gay best friend (1. why are the male best friends in romance always gay if they are not the love interest? 2. he is in the mafia or what are those mysterious business calls he always has to take??? 3. where is Stef’s book??!)🔥 Hero has great hot friends too and a hot younger brother who is a cop (Lucian-sir spare me a hand in marriage?? Nash-daddy handcuff me to your bed???)all of this combined feels like a lovechild between Mariana Zapata and Kristen Ashley and makes for a great comfort book = happy Phuong. Me writing this review: Sooo this book is about Daisy (h) and Knox (H). *looks at the cover* well okay, Daisy just left her fiancée at the altar ...*accidentally clicks on the blurb* “Naomi wasn’t just running away from her wedding.” WHO THE FUCK IS NAOMI? *opens the book in panic to check the heroine’s chapter heading* “Chapter 1 Naomi” Oh... OHHH.. okay THAT’S her name, Knox calling her Daisy all the time was only an endearment I see, and it was because Dai-Naomi had flowers in her hair when he met her..oh now I get it. The fact that I only realized now that I had the heroine’s name wrong this whole time, it’s embarrassing ahahahaha. Just for that alone, I’m sorry I can’t give this book 4 stars with good conscious, even tho I had mostly a good time reading it, but if I can’t even recall the first name of the main character, I don’t know what else my fragile mind blocked out. 🕳️🏃🏻‍♀️
  “Why are you whispering?” “Because he lives right there,” I said, pointing my glass in the direction of Knox’s cabin. “Oooh. Grumpy next-door neighbor. That’s one of my favorite tropes.” “The first time he met me, he called me trash.” “That bitch.” “Well, technically he thought I was Tina [the twin sister] when he was yelling at me in front of an entire cafe full of strangers.” “That vision-impaired bitch.” “God, I love you.” I sighed.
Don’t mind me inserting this random quote, I just love Stef. He is my spirit animal. Conclusion:Very cute book and I don’t have much to complain about beside that the first 20% didn’t rlly catch me as much as I hoped it would, but then the people of Knockemount grew on me. The heroine was too much of a goody two shoe for me sometimes, but not too bad that it would annoy me. Things We Never Got Over is not a story that will stay forever with me ahem🤡, but I honestly have a lot of good things to say about it, first and foremost all the side characters that carried this book like champs! Can’t wait to read Lucian and Sloane’s book!P.S. Not Lucy Score referencing her own book Rock Bottom Girl when Naomi needed to research about soccer 😭🤚I don't know if I find it endearing or lowkey embarrassing..the jury's still out, but most of all I wish I had that self-confidence lmao.",3

BUUUT Naomi was the star of the show for me, she was so hilarious and such a good person??? way better than i’d be in her situation that’s for sure. she was also obsessed w coffee.. that’s my kind of gal! this book was funny, emotional, and had some spice so of course I had a lovely time.“You make broken things whole again.

"106","60060431","“Naomi, this isn’t what I wanted.”
Just like the above sentence from this book, this isn't what readers like me too wanted. This was a strange book where the characters behaved in bizarre ways. The main characters, Naomi and Knox, are both above 35 years. Yet, they are  acting like irritating kindergarten kids who are obsessed with actions similar to Disney characters in some parts of the book and like toxic, emotionally manipulating, and stalking characters in the other parts. Character development is one of the most important aspects of a novel; the characters create and push the plot forward. I felt that this book's flawed character development sadly pulls the story backward.It looks like the author was totally confused about the mannerisms given to her characters. So she vacillates between polar opposite behaviors with a lot of unnecessary smut in unexpected, strange circumstances.There is a big difference between some banter and being toxic. To make things even worse this book has more than 500 pages. The blurb of this book looked promising, and many of my friends gave high ratings for it. So I read it cover to cover, hoping the author would revive it at some stage. But nothing happened even after the epilogue and the bonus epilogue. At last, it turned out to be a big disappointment.",1

"108","60060431","“Barf,” Waylay complained.
 You and me both, Waylay.Naomi Witt is a runaway bride who left her would-be husband at the altar and, for some reason, decided to run straight to her Very Evil twin sister in the podunk town of Knockemout (Knock 'Em Out), Virginia. Evil Twin Sister then steals Naomi's car and money leaving poor Naomi stuck in Knockemout. Evil Twin Sister has apparently managed to piss off the entirety of Knockemout, despite only living there for a year, and so everyone hates Naomi at first sight. But Naomi is beautiful and perfect and friendly and amazing, so she quickly wins everyone over, except for Grumpy Bad Boy Knox Morgan. This is a TropeTastic book–mistaken identity, enemies to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, good girl/bad boy, and grumpy x sunshine are all of the tropes that I can think of off the top of my head. And the book suffered for it. The only reason this book needed to be almost 600 pages was so the author could squeeze in every possible romance trope that she could think of. And despite all of these great tropes–they might be cliches but they're so popular because they work–this book sucked. I'm sorry but I'm not sorry. Usually I save one star ratings for books that offend me with some form of racism or internalized misogyny or romanticizations of abusive relationships. This book teetered on the latter two issues but never fully delved into them, but I still couldn't bring myself to give this book two stars. 🌼 I couldn't stand the hero or the heroine. Naomi is a perfect goody-two shoes, so beautiful that every single guy has a hard-on for her, so nice that any person who talks to her instantly wants to be her friend. Her fatal flaw is that she cares too much and no one ever cares about her in return. Yawn. 🌼 Knox is The Worst. This book tries to be a grumpy x sunshine book, but Knox isn't just grumpy. He's an angry, controlling, manipulative hypocrite with daddy issues. He constantly pushes Naomi around, literally, even though it's supposed to be romantic because he's a big, sexy man? I can't believe the author had the audacity to write a hero so physically controlling for her heroine who just ran away from an abusive relationship. And when Knox broke things off with Naomi for literally no reason, he had the audacity to tell her, ""Can't we be fucking adults about this?"" Look in the goddamn mirror, Knox. 🌼 This book just didn't know what it wanted to be. There was the main romance plotline, full of all the tropes mentioned above, but there were so many subplots. Again, this book really didn't need to be 600 pages and it desperately needed an editor. 🌼 The characters were so one-dimensional and every issue/inconvenience felt extremely contrived. For instance, the ongoing subplot of Naomi trying to impress the CPS lady. In the end, it turned out to be a non-issue and only existed so the CPS lady could give Naomi advice about Knox. 🌼 This book descends into Life Lesson territory so fast. I don't read books to feel lectured, and I didn't need every single character to have a drawn-out heart-to-heart with each other to grasp the main meanings behind this book. I'm starting to think that subtlety in writing is a lost art. 🌼 I almost forgot that one of Knox's main character traits is that he won the lottery. And when it's first mentioned, they talk about how Knox was smart with his money and didn't blow it all on random things, so he's still a millionaire today. But throughout the entire book, Knox is so stupid with money. He quite literally throws his money at people to buy their affection. He likes to use his money to try and control people and resorts to bribery to get his way. And I'm supposed to believe this is a guy who is smart and benevolent with his money? Nope.🌼 Despite everything happening in this book, the characters were so flat that I couldn't find it in myself to ever care about them. The only two characters that intrigued me were Waylay and Evil Twin Sister. By the way, Evil Twin Sister is apparently a scourge on the earth because she couldn't handle having a perfect twin sister. She's the most black-and-white villain ever. I wanted more depth to her; I like having complicated villains. But nope, that would require a subtlety and nuance that this author apparently is allergic to. 🌼 I really didn't understand Knox's reasons for being so anti-relationship and I honestly didn't really care. The man is supposed to be in his mid-forties but he had the emotional maturity of a nineteen-year-old frat boy. Build a bridge and get over your issues because you're making yourself and everyone around you miserable.",1
"109","60060431","I am writing this review with a heavy heart, because as fiercely as I loved the author’s other work, especially the Benevolence series, Bootleg Springs series, By a Thread, the Christmas Fix, the Worst Best Man, Rock Bottom Girl, etc., I felt the complete opposite after reading Things We Never Got Over. I generally do not include spoilers in my review, but am citing a few examples from the story to explain my low rating. If you don’t like spoilers, read no further.Knox Morgan our “hero” was anything but in my opinion. While I love an alpha and a growly grump with a squishy marshmallow center, I felt Knox was a condescending, self-righteous, steamrolling jerk. The story takes place in the small town of Knockemout, Virginia, where Knox lives in a cabin on the same property that he shares with his widowed grandmother. He’s 43 and won $11 million in the lottery a few years back which caused a rift between him and his only brother, Nash, the town’s chief of police, whom I adored. It wasn’t an argument over money, as Knox did offer him a generous share, it was how Knox reacted when Nash refused. Knox was arrogant and demeaning, and treated Nash horribly from beginning to end in my opinion. While not estranged, Knox obviously held resentments and needed professional help. Nash was a good man, level headed and honorable, and did not deserve it. We meet our heroine, Naomi, the day after she leaves her fiancé (for good reason) at the altar and blows into town in a whirlwind to help her evil twin sister, Tina. With a hopeful heart and generous spirit, Naomi once again falls into her trap and is blindsided by her wickedness as she stole her car and ransacked her hotel room. But her frown turned upside down when she was introduced to her adorable 11-year-old niece, Waylay, and agrees to become her guardian, even though she’s not sure how she will manage. When Knox meets Naomi at a local coffee shop, he believes she is her identical twin, causes a scene, and is anything but pleasant. I loved the sass she volleyed back to Knox and how easily she could read him and was not intimidated. Upon learning she is “not Tina” (her nickname did make me laugh), Knox offers to help her by belting out directives and taking her to an adorable cottage on his grandmother’s property. Naomi was ever so grateful and humble, and things were looking up as she was able to work out a deal with Liza J. Knox showed no respect to his brother when he officially came to investigate the break-in and car theft. The tension was so thick between the brothers that Knox egged Nash on and challenged him to a fight saying, “I saw her first.” Nash may have thrown the first punch, but after Knox punched his brother in the face, he internalized that “messing up Nash was always gratifying.” It was the first of several fistfights that Knox got into, which is a really big turn off for me. Naomi scored a job and didn’t realize it was at the local bar Knox owned. She was tired and nervous, as she never worked in the restaurant industry before, and instead of welcoming her, Knox humiliated her and demanded she “get out,” and that he “didn’t want her around.” He said, “I’m not working with some uppity, needy pain in the a$$.” This is the same woman who just had her whole life upended–and he knew this! She left her fiancé, quite her job, left her home, was missing her wallet, phone and car, taken responsibility for her niece, and was trying to start over, and he was such a crass a-hole. Even though she was a bit naive, Naomi was so sweet and had so much character. She tried her best to keep her composure, worked all night against his wishes to earn a few bucks, and then Knox had a change of heart asking her to stay. He was so hot and cold that it gave me whiplash. I feel Knox suffers from borderline personality disorder (fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, shifting self-image, impulsive, self-destructive, extreme emotional mood swings, chronic feelings of emptiness, and explosive anger.) He also possesses a narcissist’s grandiose sense of self-importance, which leads him to feel a sense of entitlement, and expects everyone to comply with his expectations without question. He was Jekyll and Hyde, gaslighting and mistreating her over and over and yet she still fell in love. Then breaks her heart and leaves...just like he said he would, and has the nerve to sulk! Out of concern Nash asked his brother as to why he broke things off, and Knox replied with, “Problem...with you helping yourself to my leftovers? Nah. Better she didn’t go to waste.” There wasn’t any romance unless you consider the time he offered to take her on a lunch date, then tossed a bagged PBJ onto her lap in his truck, convincing her to partake in an afternoon delight. Sadly, she was starry-eyed and lacked the confidence to kick him to the curb. Her life was constantly filled with drama and stress with her sister’s illegal activities, yet she remained cheerful, tried to do right by her niece planning activities to support her emotional health, all while working two jobs to become financially secure. Watching Waylay feel safe and loved for the first time in her life was really emotional. I was totally invested in their relationship and enjoyed how they got to know one another, were both hopeful for a brighter future, and dealt with Tina’s betrayal. They were victims and survivors, and I admired their strength, perseverance, and positive attitude. Naomi selflessly sold her wedding dress and used it to by her niece clothes, sold her home so she could buy a car, and agreed to clean and organize his grandmother’s house in exchange for rent. She was hardworking, resilient, and a go-getter, earning my total respect. And after Knox tossed Naomi and Waylay “like a discarded receipt he no longer needed,” she held her head high and repeatedly asked him to stop contacting her, but he didn’t respect her wishes and continued to stalk her. Then an incident happened with her sister, and he TOLD her they were getting back together. He never asked her, nor did he apologize, and to my great disappointment, she succumbed. I wish I could jump in the story and tell her that she doesn’t need Knox's scraps of affection and that she deserves better.This story does end with a HEA for the couple, and Knox did make an effort to change towards the end, but it was a little too late for me. We all have hang-ups, but it doesn’t mean we go through life as a jerk. I felt he was emotionally abusive, controlling, and passive-aggressive. Lucy Score is one of my favorite authors, and even though I did not care for the hero of this story, I will be continuing with the series and look forward to seeing who falls in love next in Knockemout. I really liked her friend Stef from home, Simone the local librarian, Nash, her parents, his grandmom, and the local townsfolk.",2
"110","60060431","***4.5 STARS***This is my first book by Lucy Score but it will definitely not be my last.Naomi comes to the small town of Knockemout after leaving her fiancée at the alter and to come help her twin sister Tina. When she gets to town she realizes her sister had caused all kinds of hell in town and has a bad reputation. In fact she is thought to be her sister when she goes to the local cafe and Knox Morgan shows up to “escort” her out of town. The couple are thrown together and Naomi realizes that she has an eleven year old niece that she knew nothing about which ties her to the small town.Very well written. Excellent storytelling, pacing, banter and dialogue. I loved Knox. He is the grumpy gorgeous hunk that has sworn off relationships and it is fun watching him fall. The only drawback I had was the length. It was a long book. But it kept my attention.I highly recommend it.",5
"111","60060431","2.5 stars  I’m gonna bullet point this review for brevity’s sake, because at this point, the general consensus is that everyone loved this book and made it a bestseller so they must have seen something in it that I didn’t. If you loved the book, don’t read this, because I honestly I hated it. • too long for what it actually contained. (spoiler alert, it was mostly sexy scenes which added nothing to the plot)If I read a 600 pages book I’m expecting it to tie all the issues nicely by the end of the book. To provide answers to all the questions and most importantly to show me true character growth. This book - did not.• I keep hearing this described as a grumpy/sunshine pairing when it comes to the hero and heroine and unless I forgot what that means I’m pretty sure (actually, I would bet my life on it) that the hero Knox, was not grumpy, he was an absolute a$$hole, nothing less, nothing more. When someone acts rude, and downright verbally abusive to someone else for no reason whatsoever and keeps going back and forth with this attitude- again - for no reason whatsoever, that’s not a grumpy person - to me grumpy is maybe someone a little surly, a little rude, a little, blunt and a little impatient when it comes to general human interaction - and their attitude is not restricted to any one person in particular but rather everyone they encounter. The hero in this book had no reason to behave the way he did and I was just put off by him for most of the book. Also considering his age (I don’t like to say that someone should act a certain way according to their age - because God knows I’m the poster child for do Not act your age, but for a 40 something man to be so…. immature and irrational, it majorly put me off, no, thank you) • The heroine, I liked her, but I would have loved to see her more settled into her own and knowing exactly who she is and what she wants by the end of the book. She does make some decisions but I still feel like she lets the events that happened to her and the people in her life derail most of her individual and personal decisions. • the last point I’m gonna make but not necessarily the last thing that troubled me in this book, is that the heroine’s niece wasn’t given the proper story act that she needed. That was a child that was abandoned and she definitely had issues because of it - it’s just not possible otherwise and yet it felt like that whole situation was just used to give us an intro into the story but it wasn’t explored with the respect and dedication it needed to be. I actually would have loved to see that part play out, and I thought it was going to after reading the synopsis- but instead this veered into completely different grounds.So why did I give it 3 stars? Because I think it’s well written and it could be an overall a good time for most people, objectively, this wasn’t an awful book, it definitely wasn’t what I would consider a good story but the elements were there. In conclusion, I didn’t buy into the hype of this book. Do I get it? Yes, it does have a small town vibe, a hero who acts like an a$$ and a heroine who is trying her best and is a genuinely nice person. But is this worth the praises I’ve heard? Absolutely not. There are loads of books with this trope which have done it better and in less pages but are unfortunately not as popular.",3

  “You make broken things whole again. Me. You made me whole. And every time you smile at me, I feel like I hit the lottery again.”
Things We Never Got Over was better than my expectations only because I went in with no expectations. I read it only for the fun and giggles and there were moments I was cringing so hard because how can you not when the characters in this book don't behave like adults?!This book was never in my 2024 book lists and it was a spontaneous decision to start this book and mostly it was because I wanted to see what all the hype is about. I jumped head first into the story and even loved the beginning and how the runaway bride Naomi Witt ended up being a guardian to an 11 year old kid. It was all trouble and chaos and I was really enjoying the banter and verbal sparring between Knox and Naomi. But this book did not needed 550+ pages! Everything was slow and there were too many useless small town moments with people's meddling. The whole thing could've been wrapped up in 400 pages max.The plot was interesting enough to keep me continue reading it. The story started off as an easy read with a few cringy and funny moments here and there. The story also went from hilarious to emotional and chaotic drama to criminal plot and everything was just too much for a normal small town romance story. Naomi and Waylay are the only main characters I actually liked. It was the bond between these two and how it grew stronger and stronger with each chapter. How Naomi did everything she could to help her niece and it was admirable because Naomi took her in without second guessing anything.➸ Naomi Witt: I liked her and her sarcasm was funny but not when she used it during sex. Naomi is the girl who hides behind the “I'm the good twin” façade and her life will go up in flames if she didn't had atleast a bucket full of coffee and if things didn't go according to her check-list. 
  “There’s a difference between taking care of someone because you love them and taking care of someone because you want them to love you.”
➸ Knox Morgan: Don't get me started on “Knox Morgan The Caveman” I am usually a sucker for grumpy x sunshine trope but Knox was an asshole type of grumpy and I get it was just who he was but the things he said to Naomi just because she wasn't his type of girl really annoyed me. His actions though are the literal opposites of what his words. He is protective of Waylay and Naomi and I liked it when he stepped up to help them with everything.
  “He was unfairly gorgeous. Too bad about the whole terrible personality thing.”
➸ Waylay: She was the most mature and the smartest character in this book and that's saying something because most of the characters in this book are in their late 30s or early 40s! The romance was cute and endearing at times and I liked the enemies to fake dating to lovers trope. I liked the contrasts between their personalities and their lives. I liked the back and forth between them as they fight their feelings and the foreshadowing about why that was. But they are also the most idiotic characters and especially Knox who broke up with Naomi for no reason. The third-act break up was so useless and it was just thrown in the book just for the sake of extra drama and to increase the length of this book. Also, I liked that he called her “Daisy” and the reason behind it was so sweet, but he also called her “Daze” which I guess is short for Daisy but that should be “Dais” right? I don't know why but that bothered me a lot in this book 😂
  “Why don’t you ever fucking listen?” he grumbled, lips moving against my hair.“Because sometimes people don’t know how to ask for what they really need. You needed a hug.”“No. I didn’t,” he rasped. He was quiet for a long moment, and I listened to his heartbeat. “I needed you.”
➙ Things I liked:🌼 Found family trope🌼 Sunshine runaway bride and grumpy bad boy barber and the enemies to lovers trope🌼 Waylay the smartest kid and Waylon the cutest dog🌼 The horrible and catastrophic first meet-cute🌼 All Naomi and Waylay bonding moments🌼 The small town setting and it's gossips🌼 Naomi's supportive and loving parents 🌼 Liza J the coolest granny🌼 The friendships where they will always have your back🌼 All the Luciane and Sloane crumbs! I am already obsessed with these two 🤭🌼 Epilogue and the bonus epilogue ➙ Things I did not like:➾ The first spicy scene because Lucy ruined it with her fancy vocabulary like - “Professional ruiner of vaginas” - “magical wand that cast orgasm spells” - “A thick, purple-headed leader in the. world of erect penises” - “My tight, wet wonderland.”➾ Knox peeing in his backyard with his dog 😭 someone needs to tell Lucy and Knox that it's NOT normal for a man in his 40s!!➾ Knox's over the top territorial and caveman shit. I like that in quality in MMCs but Knox was just too much for me.➾ The useless love triangle between Naomi and Morgan brothers in the first half of the book➾ Pacing and the length of this book➾ The third-act breakup and the drama in the endI am invested in Knockemout and the other couple's stories especially Luciane and Sloane's story! Hopefully, they are better than this one.————————I'm starting this book with very low expectations bcs i have only read bad reviews for this book but the average rating tells another story 👀 so here goes nothing 🤞🏻",3
"113","60060431","I saw a video saying this book was copaganda and suddenly everything makes more sense 💀Okay, so I really need to stop taking book recs from certain people.I don't even really want to talk about this book a lot, so I'm just going to list what I didn't like:-How the days worked? She would wake up, have a giant ass cup of coffee, do one activity, be exhausted, go to sleep, and then it was the next day, BUT she would pick up the kid from the bus from the day before. I don't know if that made sense, but that's the thing, IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. So basically, my explanation is perfect.-Coffee was this girl's ENTIRE personality for most of the book. I don't mind characters having an obsession with a food or drink, but when it's ALL they talk about, think about, or go get, it's ANNOYING.-This eleven-year-old was acting like a seventeen-year-old which I understand to a certain point since she kinda raised herself and was on her own, BUT the way she talked is what annoyed me the most. Kids can be more mature, but it should still show that they are a child through their speech mannerisms.-I didn't really like Knox. I don't really have anything to say about him. He didn't stand out, was bland, was an idiot (LIKE FRL), and pissed me off.-The ""climax"" with the sister and her boyfriend was so unrealistic I was dying laughing. And not in a good way 💀-The pacing was not for me. It was very insta-lovey just without them admitting it. I didn't feel the tension the characters were apparently experiencing and that really just turns me off the book. IF I DON'T FEEL THE TENSION, I DON'T WANT IT :)-Finally, the repetition. Oh my god, the amount of times I read that this girl always took care of others and didn't take the time to see what she wanted or needed, was the most infuriating thing EVER.Honestly, I should have DNFed because even the scenes I was looking forward to in the book (the ones promoting it on TikTok, you guys know what I mean) were a letdown. 2.5 stars for some of the spice scenes and the two scenes that made me smile.",2

You guys do not know how excited I am to write this review because this book meant so much to me and I honestly didnt think a book could mean so much to someone until I read this 🥺 It was so beautifully written, with such emotion, Only one book has managed to make me cry (As long as the lemon trees grow"") while this one did not make me sob, It brought me so close to it when I read the epilogue because it was perfect 🙂‍↕️✋🏻 I could have binged this book in one sitting because I was literally free but I was so attached to these characters that I was delaying an inevitable goodbye which hit me so hard because within a span of 400 pages, they gave me so much and took it all away as I closed the book 😔✋🏻 Reading this book was such a serene experience, makes me want to read every Abby book out there because this was fucking beautiful. I have never in my life read a book filled with so much feeling, such perfect representation of guilt, self-hate, anxiety and neglect as this 😮‍💨This book perfectly captures gut-wrenching moments mixed with feel-good, heartfelt moments, written with so much emotion that it honestly felt like I was experiencing all this in real life with them with me because there is no way a book can have me on the verge of tears imagining them sitting together as they laugh and live a happy life or make me feel so angry at a character for treating her daughter so bad and I can not stress on how the slow burn made me feel AHHH!! I wanted everything and it eventually gave me everything 😭. The writing was simply breathtaking, it reminded me so much of Emily Henry because usually her books are the type to make me feel this way. The way it described love is gonna make you believe in it 🩷I feel like another way to look at why this book is so perfect for us is because we had unbelievably high expectations like you do not know how high are expectations were, we singlehandedly believed that this would be our summer read and the anticipation that led to this book because were waiting to read it in June but my copy took a month to arrive and then one thing led to another and before we knew it, and we learned that you need to read the first two books (not true, this could be read as a stand alone) 😭😭 but for a better experience we did and we really enjoyed these two but they can not be compared to this masterpiece. It was everything, it managed to exceed everyone of our expectations and we loved every second of it 😌 This showed how good of a book this was.The characters in this book were so fucking precious 🥹. I wanted hug all of them because they all deserved so much better than what they got, We follow two characters Emma and Justin who meet over a twitter thread and having similar relationship problems enter a fling 'Just for the summer' and one thing leads to another and to know more you would have to read this book because so much happens and I am still stuck in those moments 😔😮‍💨✋🏻
  “You're not asking too much,"" he said. ""You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”
Justin was the epitome of 'If he wanted to he would' because he did!! 😌 I love how good Abby Jimenez's men are. All of them are literally green flags. He was everything that you would look for a man. That man was the standard because no one has ever put themselves out that much for anyone, he was fully committed, the way he comforted and understood Emma's trauma and pain and tried to give her time and be there for her was so precious for me because this should be the bare minimum tbh these days, he did all this while struggling himself with his mom going to jail and him having to take care of his family, all of it put together complimented the book well.I mean how can you not love him, he's 6ft, charming, charismatic, funny and has dimples + is a software engineer and uses his skills to make fun things for his gf 🤭. I love, love, loved the effort that he put into this relationship and I also love the found family aspect that we got because of him, this whole series tying up to this moment felt like a massive found family and I was in love with it.
  “In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy,”
Emma was such a strong character tbh because it's so hard to find books without any annoying female characters and I was so happy when I found Emma to be so realistic and relatable 😭 I wont agree with anyone saying Emma didn't deal with anything in a mature way-✋🏻 Live with a mother who abandons you and neglects you and then judge her✋🏻. Emma was so cute, I loved her and I literally grew so close to her and so fond of her that everything that came rolling down on her made me so sad and angry. I loved the way her character looked at the world, where she would look at things with more empathy and would encourage people to do that as well. People like her are a gem and should be protected at all costs 🩷I hated Emma's mother sm 😡 she made me furious because what she did was unforgivable!! to think that Emma could have gotten so much love and such a nice past- but she didn't because Amber the fucking bitch was to selfish to do that, she would abandon her and ruin her life, would make her feel like shit and would not care for her or more or less pay attention to her 💔 Especially chapter 41 where she talks to him (yk who) and he tells her about his past and she thinks that's it could've been for her.
  “Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”
Maddy is the friend we alll want and I am so happy and thankful to god for giving me friends like her because she was perfect. She understood Emma so well, gave her reality checks and supported her, helped Justin figure her out and overall I just loved how she was there for her always. I also loved Emma's relationship with Justin's brother and I liked how Justin and Emma rekindled because of them<333
  “What are you thinking?” I asked. He didn’t answer for a long moment. When he did, he did it with his eyes closed. “All I ever think about is you.”
The romance was everything that I ever wanted. It was everything. I loved it so much that I literally have no words to describe it, it made me feel every emotion that is out there to exist 🥹 Justin and Emma were made for each other, it was everything that I was looking for in a moment, there banter alone was so well done and their chemistry was perfect tbh. Their domestic scenes had me swooning 😮‍💨 where they would cook together and help the kids and I loved how she would just extend her trip. That first kiss scene literally gave me and Emma both butterflies, it was so well done. Although it's supposed to be a fling but there's so much slow burn and angst and tension filled in this book 🥵 The perfect balance of everything. Like its the perfect fucking combo for everyone out there. I genuinely would read it every year/ every summer.Scenes that I absolutely loved:1, Justin making Emma pre-date questionnaires and giving her invitations 🤭2, the whole toilet king banter 😭���🏻3, Dual pov 🙂‍↕️4, The confrontation between Emma and her mother 🥺5, Chapter 40 😨6, Justin paddle boating his way through to get on an island just because Emma called him and told him that she was sick 🥹7, The airport hotel scene between Maddy and Emma 🫂8, Sarah emergency contact list scene + JustinEmma domestic scenes 🩷9, Justin and Emma on the date where Leigh and his mom crash with them 🤣10, the first and the last chapter 🩷🫂
  “The moment Emma came into view, my entire world slipped into slow motion. My brain took a screenshot. I felt the moment freeze and save. She was beautiful.”
The plot (Spoilers will be mentioned) started off so cute with the whole fling and it served well for their banter and chemistry and I was excited to see where all of it would go tbh because I wanted to see how all of it would end and oh my god that plot twist that came and hit us?? like me and Roxy were shooketh like we could have figured this out so fast but we were so blind like we were actually so blind and Jimenez did such a mega job keeping us distracted with Justin and Emma that we didnt even figure out the elephant in the room SPOILERS umm chapter 40?? Daniel and Emma being siblings?? I felt so bad for her when Daniel and her talked and Amber was litr mentioned + Neil was right there HOW did we not notice him LMAOO. anyways I liked how Daniel and Emma got their good moments and she had a better life and found someone to love just because of a summer fling SPOILERS ENDOverall, an amazing read!! I went in with extremely high expectations and read every single word there was to read!! Would definitely recommend!Some of the quotes that I loved; 
  “The love stories sold us the wrong thing. The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about. Taking the end piece of the bread at breakfast so she can have the last middle piece for her sandwich when you pack her lunch. Making sure her car always has gas so she never has to stop at the pump. Telling her you’re not cold and to take your jacket when you are in fact, very, very cold. It’s watching TV on a rainy Sunday while you’re doing laundry and turning her light off when she’s fallen asleep reading. Sharing pizza crusts and laughing about something the kids did and taking care of each other when you’re sick. It isn’t glamorous, it isn’t all butterflies and stars in your eyes. It’s real. This is the kind of love that forever is made of. Because if it’s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the love songs are playing and the moon is out.”.“Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.”.“Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”.“Sometimes I feel like the seasons could come and go and come and go, a hundred years could pass, a thousand, the ground could collapse under us, this house could crumble and go back to the earth, and we would still be standing here frozen in time, because every second I’m with you is eternal. I’ve never felt anything like it.”.“Because when you’re in love, you do hard things.”.“I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”.“To me, love meant you stayed. But now I understood that love sometimes means you let someone go.”.“This is the thing nobody tells you about The One. How they’re timeless. How the moment they pop up again you’re right back in it, right where you left off.”.“Tell me your day today from start to finish.”

"119","195820807","Reading this book was such an exhausting experience. This was my first book by Abby Jimenez and it put me off to the point that am no longer sure if I want to read any of her other books. ✔️ Online meet cute✔️ Insta lovey✔️ Found family This was one of the most bland and emotionless writing I have read in a while.  There were no feelings to it, I surely did not feel a single thing reading it. The plot execution was so messy and had no direction.  The romance was very mid.  The two characters start off okay but then their personalities clash. The chemistry is meh. They do have some cute moments but I could not feel a single thing for them. Justin and Emma have issues of their own but Justin deals with things a tad more maturely compared to Emma. Sure, I feel bad for Emma but the way her story and character was written is just  so damn boring.  Justin's siblings were more cute and I would rather read about them than this tiresome book. I skimmed it towards the end and have no regrets. I realize that it's probably just me who didn't like it but please go in with low expectations. Also, what is the purpose of marketing it as a standalone if we have to read her other books first in order to start liking it?!~•~•~Found family? Forced proximity? Summer fling? Online meet cute?

The banter and just silliness that leaves a smile stretched on your face makes the feel goodness of this book undeniable.

"125","195820807","Oh boy! Too many words come to mind at once, creating a huge cacophony. They're not enough to express how much I loved this book. Great, brilliant, adorable words aren't doing justice for this most poignant book, and even the best couple and best book boyfriend (OMG: don’t you think Justin is like cinnamon rolls meets mud pie? This character completely changed my perspective about the name, although I still think both Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake are rubbing me the wrong way) created by Abby Jimenez.I used to think “Part of Your World” was her best work, but “Just for the Summer” exceeded it with Toilet King references, fantastic dating options, so many ugly cries, and sweetest, sighing, swoon-smile-repeat moments blended in heavy triggering subjects that are handled with care and in a realistic way, including PTSD, panic attacks, death, child neglect, dysfunctional family, and mental health issues.The witty and sweet dialogues, catchy banters, physical attraction, and emotional intimacy, along with the perfect chemistry between Emma and Justin, are pure perfection! Even though they met through a Reddit thread that turned into humorous messages and sweet phone calls during the hardest times of their lives, their blooming friendship and curse-breaking designated dates—including four dates, one kiss, and a breakup—are a scenario doomed to fail when the attraction hits the roof.Another best part of the book is seeing cameos from the “Part of Your World” universe. Seeing those favorite characters in this book made me smile a lot.Let’s take a closer look at the plot:The book opens with a laugh-out-loud “Am I the asshole?” Reddit thread written by Justin, a cute, caring 29-year-old engineer who sees his situation as a good luck charm, meaning each woman he dates finds their significant other immediately after their breakup, and they even invite him to their weddings.Emma, a 28-year-old traveling nurse, reads this thread during her lunch break with her bestie Maddie, and she decides to DM the guy because she’s also the good luck charm that every man she dates marries immediately after the breakup. Justin decides to write her back, which turns into very entertaining correspondences. A few days later, they start talking on the phone, and eventually Justin comes up with an interesting offer: if they date each other and break up, they can also break the curse and have a chance to find their soulmates. Emma finds this plan unreasonable at first. She and Maddy had already decided to fly to Hawaii for their rest residence, but as long as she spends more time with Justin on the phone, she decides to change her plans and rent a cozy cottage in Minnesota for only six weeks to help her realize their date plan.She even plays the guilt card to convince Maddy. The plan is simple: they’ll date only for a few weeks, kiss each other goodbye, and ride off into the sunset with their own future soulmates. But when sparks start flying around them and their first meeting turns into being hit by a love truck, the detailed plans, which included more surveys and questionnaires, are fated to fail. Especially when both of them struggle with unexpected mommy-related family issues, which push them toward each other, and Emma, who resists taking people into her heart, finds herself letting not only Justin but his entire family in. Could she learn to set roots somewhere? Could she learn to dissect the barriers to make herself small and open her heart fully to love and be cherished in return?Overall: three words, “I loved it,” and two more words, “read it”! This is one of the best romance novels of the year, and don’t you dare miss it!Oh boy, I couldn’t tell you how much I appreciate this digital reviewer copy I received and how thankful I am to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for sending me this ARC copy in exchange for my honest review. And thanks a lot to Abby Jimenez for writing this book, lighting up my mood, making me laugh till my stomach aches, and making me cry till I had the best raccoon makeup.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<",5

"127","195820807","2/5Unfortunately, a bit of a letdown for me. I couldn’t connect to the main characters, the romance felt like a side character and had no depth, and the plot felt all over the place at times and wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. While reading it, I felt literally nothing, as if someone had taken away all my emotions. I don't like to admit it because I don't like doing it in books, but the number of pages I skipped because I was so bored is pretty embarrassing. Our main characters had their first kiss and I was close to falling asleep. Also, is it possible to feel overwhelmed by the amount of things happening in a book to the point that you forget that it is even a romance? Because that's exactly how I felt for most of the story. I recently read a short novella by Abby Jimenez The Worst Wingman Ever and I felt exactly the same, as if the romance was a side plot and the problems and difficulties of the main characters the main. Don't get me wrong, I even liked how the author handled them here, but for the romance book it was supposed to be, the romance was actually my least favorite thing here.*Thank you to NetGalley for the advance copy in exchange for an honest review!*",2
"128","195820807","so! this is what we're working with:1) overly simplistic writing. the characters are almost thirty but the writing feels juvenile?2) insta love. there was NO build up to their relationship. they talked for two seconds and he was (for some reason that is still unbeknownst to me) obsessed with her?? as in ""'i would follow her to the ends of the earth' after six weeks"" kind of obsessed? like bffr that is actually concerning. 3) third act breakup (that doesn't even get resolved properly). they are not ""together"" until the last idk 10 pages of this book??4) lots of trauma, and yet, underdeveloped and uninteresting characters? dreams/hopes/goals, fears/insecurities, hobbies/likes/dislikes? for emma, all of this revolved around the same thing: her issues with her mother. where's the rest of her personality?? she felt so one dimensional, as if she existed only on one plane and that plane was a manifestation of her childhood trauma. go girl give us absolutely nothing. this was, in short, incredibly disappointing. but it was also bingeable and, thankfully, quite entertaining so do with that what you will <3",2

Could their own bad luck actually cancel each other's out? Just a few simple rules and they could be on their way to true love, right? Right! 4 dates...one kiss...and a breakup. & just for the summer!!I feel like I say this every time Abby drops a new book but...this is her BEST BOOK YET! Fans of Abby will devour this one and readers who may be new to her writing will no doubt want to go back and connect all the dots from her previous books. One big difference with Just For the Summer compared to her previous books...there is very little of the whole miscommunication trope--bonus points for me! The dual POV gives us a glimpse of two completely different stories, and lives, and slowly merges them into one complex, yet beautiful, story. One of friendship, forgiveness, healing, and the life changing realization that you ARE worthy of love! There were twists I was not expecting and not at all prepared for!! A summer lake house setting & many hilarious and lovable side characters. Laugh out loud funny, the perfect beachy read & also emotional and Kleenex worthy--Just for the Summer is a 5 star heartfelt must-read. Thank you to NetGalley and Forever Publishing for granting my wish in exchange for my honest review. I cannot wait to see what Abby dreams up next!",5

"132","195820807","4 stars ᯓᡣ𐭩I'm so attached to the characters 😭. It's not even the romance that made me love it (it was), but the way the traumas were dealt with and how unrealistically realistic it was. Things were handled in a practical and mature way. It was definitely not a summer-vibes book because of the characters!► Emma & Justin met through Reddit when he told abt his 'bad-good luck charm' that all his dates end up finding their THE ONE, while he remains single, and the same thing happened to Emma. They connected with each other, and it all started.ᝰ. 
  “four dates, one kiss, and a breakup. Just for the summer.”
⌞ Emma Grant & Justin Dahl ⌝ It was insta-love (revealed later lol). The whole falling in love shouldn’t have happened, but *shrugs* they had an arrangement. Now, I did enjoy their moments. The dates were really cute and thoughtful. The questionnaires that Justin made solely for Emma regarding dates were literally screaming 'if he wanted to, he would'.⌗ – 
  “You’re just in a different place than I am—”“Then meet me where I am.”
gosh I loved how many times he did things out of his comfort zone for her. HE PADDLED ON A FLOATIE FOR AN HOUR TO HER COTTAGE WHEN SHE WAS SICK. I don't even need to say more. He met her where she was.⌗ – 
  “Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”
I want to pull Emma out and hug her 🥲💗 Her traumas made me so emotional, the things she faced. She was definitely making practical choices when she didn’t want to stay, but I’m glad that Maddy was there to guide her and give her a reality check. It hurts, but still. i hate her mom sfm. I thought she had good moments and would redeem herself, but my bad. She sucked, and I want her in a dumpster pls. ⌗ – 
  “What’s wrong? Tell me what you’re thinking.”I paused. “I’m thinking I like you a lot more than you like me.”
Their romance was cute, but they both had a lot of baggage. Justin was sometimes right about 'how his feelings for her are more than hers are for him,' and it was understandable from his pov, while Emma kind of struggled with her feelings. The breakup & his little anger after that was justifying, but I'm glad he understood her. The last moment when she told him she loved him, ugh 😭 their hug!!!!!!! I love them. 🧸🎀The epilogue was so cute fr 😭, and I'm so happy that their mom came back from prison after 2 years instead of 6. seriously, Justin taking care of his 3 siblings and talking about the responsibility was so hard. (him with Chelsea melted my heart ffs). him talking about his MOM BEING A SINGLE PARENT hit way too close to home. The words they used tore me up because it kind of helped me feel what my own mom must be feeling. nvm, this book had some great lessons innit.Maddy was harsh about her mom most of the time,and I kind of saw her as inconsiderate at the start, but tbh, i understand her. Telling someone one thing again and again and seeing them being hurt by it every freaking time is frustrating. You just can't let your friend or someone you love suffer like that. Not by anyone. Maddy literally stole my heart! 😭 I was kind of rooting for Neil & his 'ex' (not knowing she was book 1's fmc), but when i found out what he did 💀 lmao. I'm glad the author didn’t give him his HEA, but he did change... nvm WHO GIVES A F?ᝰ. 
  “Four dates. A kiss. No breakup.”“Not just for the summer?”“No. Forever this time.”",4
"133","195820807","Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, writes romances that I enjoy more than Abby Jimenez! She makes me want to crawl inside the pages of her books and become one of her characters, so I can marry her “too good to be true” MMC, have a best friend like her MFC will have, and own one of the adorable (or ugly!) rescue dogs that she creates! (here’s looking at you, Brad!) 🐶I am never approved for her ARCs, and this was one of my MOST anticipated books for 2024, so you know I planned to start reading it on publication day-and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Justin thinks he has been cursed-every woman he dates and breaks up with goes on to find their soulmate in the very NEXT person they date. He posts about it on Reddit and now it is all over the internet. Emma and her BFF, see the post and send him a DM, admitting that Emma seems to have the same problem. In a flirty response, he suggests that dating each other, could break the curse. Currently on assignment in Colorado, the friends who are traveling nurses, are due to go to Hawaii next, and a stint in Minnesota where Justin lives, was not even on their TOP 25 list of destinations. But when two positions open up at a prestigious hospital in Minneapolis, complete with an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka, it seems fated that Emma give “breaking the curse” a try-even if true love wasn’t really something she was looking for.The result? Another book that had me laughing and crying and cheering a couple on! With cameos from characters from the “Yours Truly” and “Part of Your World” an earlier two book series-I devoured this unputdownable book! And, the ending? Chef’s kiss! 😘 Definitely BEACH 🏖️ BAG approved!Thank You to the Chandler Public library for the loan of both the Audible and written copies on publication day, which I paired for another wonderful experience.

"134","195820807","Thank you Forever Pub for the ARC. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  writing:  very mid |  plot:  okay |  ending:  THANK GOD |  3.5 rounded up  my opinion FYI: this is insta-love with fade to bland grey spiceDespite the writing being extremely mid, I'm tossing this 4 stars (3.5 rounded up) because Abby got my ass with Emma's character arc. I was INVESTED. If she hadn't extracted her head from delulu-land, I would've given this one star so brace yourself while reading this. I honestly didn't give AF about the romance, I was on edge the entire time waiting to see how the dynamic between Emma and her ain't shit womb donor (mom) shook out. But seriously, Emma almost made me DNF because her toxic positivity was making my blood pressure skyrocket. The blurb leads you to believe this is a less misogynist Good Luck Chuck, but the curse storyline was ultimately insignificant. Also, if you really think about it, it makes no sense Emma would give up Hawaii for Minnesota (this felt like a crime) to break the relationship curse when her entire ""thing"" is she's constantly on the move and refuses to settle down. If she doesn't want to stay in one place, why does it matter that her exes find their soulmates after they break up? Seems like the curse was actually working in her favor because she never had to worry about ""the one that got away"". But I digress...This is my first Abby Jiminez that I completed (dnfed Yours Truly—no I won't be taking questions at this time) and I did find it funny. I liked the AITA post to kick things off and to tie it all together at the end. Random, but I've noticed that authors are allergic to dialogue tags these days. Not all dialogue needs tags, but I find it odd that emotionally charged exchanges were devoid of them. It's giving interview transcript and I'm not a fan of it. Feels lazy. No spoilies but I did like the conclusion of the book and I found the characters decently flushed out. Maddy is the fucking REALEST. She deserves ALLLLLLLL the good things in life. I hope her size is never sold out during sales, she never gets janky substitutions when ordering groceries online, and that her socks always match. She NEVER complained about Emma's selfishness; she was fiercely protective, patient, and endlessly selfless. Also, Justin's backstory was interesting. Definitely unique. Yes, the stress of his family situation was downplayed big time, but at least it was something different than the ""my mom died when I was young"" backstory that we usually see for MMCs. I think Justin was too good for Emma... He and Maddy should've linked up together tbh.Usually I only share quotes that make me wanna gauge my eyes out with hot spoons but in this case, I'm gonna share an excerpt that had me questioning if someone was cutting onions in close proximity of me: ""You're not asking for too much. You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.""  Faaaacccttttsss though (within reason). Your ""too much"" for someone will be another person's bare minimum. All in all, this book kept my attention and threw me for a loop several times. I was ON EDGE. So I have no choice but to give Abby her flowers for taking me on a wild ass ride.  pros & cons pros: good character arc with Emma, Maddy is a real one, Justin was a likeable MMC (epitome of ""if he wanted to, he would"") with a unique backstory, strong resolution to Emma's story and their relationship, funny at times, interesting premise although not fully executed cons: very bland, emotionless writing... it was really the character's actions/beliefs that kept me emotionally involved, lack of dialogue tags during heated scenes watered things down, Emma's motivation to break the curse made no sense____Check out my YouTube and my TikTok",4
"135","195820807","I hate to say it but I think this was my least favorite of the series. There’s only so much self sabotage a girl can take. I found Justin to be the most unrealistic of the leading men… boys like that do not exist. There were definitely some sweet parts I enjoyed, but they were always immediately followed by something annoying. I’m thankful to Abby J for getting me back into romance but I’m ready to try out a new author!",3

"138","195820807","Omg. I've finally had success with an Abby Jimenez book. This was so cute! What a breath of fresh air! I really enjoyed this book so freaking much. And if it's helpful to anyone- I am not a fan of the first two books in this series and more or less was about to give up on Abby - it's nothing that she as an author is doing wrong. I've just found her stories to be a little too Hallmarky for my taste?Maybe not Hallmark, but just not my type of cheese? Anyway, to my point- if you are someone that was on the fence you may just very well love this one, because I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it in comparison. ╰┈➤ 𝓠𝓾𝓲𝓬𝓴 𝓢𝓾𝓶𝓶𝓪𝓻𝔂 ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚Emma and her best friend Maddy are travel nurses, working in hospitals three months at a time while seeing the country. A few weeks prior to moving to yet another destination, Emma stumbles upon a trending Reddit thread titled 'Am I the Asshole' written by a man in Minnesota who thinks he's cursed. Each time he's had a failed relationship, the ex partner ends up finding their soulmate. Emma having similar experiences as of late, the two devise a plan to break this curse and date each other only to end it after the summer- in the hopes that they will each find their person.╰┈➤ 𝓜𝔂 𝓣𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓰𝓱𝓽𝓼 ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚You know what, just thinking about to the core events of the book now. I think for me personally where this story is different than the other two Jimenez books I've read is that it offers more depth. The characters are relatable and down to earth. Everyone knows how to peel a potato and sweep a floor here. They experience highs and lows and life challenges. They're all still very humorous and had me laughing out loud a few times.: ̗̀➛ The MMC- Justin. He's literally the best. Sweet and considerate, he brings her lunch while she's at work.: ̗̀➛ The FMC- Emma. She has some emotional baggage which is completely understandable once you meet her mom. But she's also resilient and strong willed. She's determined and kind hearted despite everything she's been through. There's nothing exceptionally different with this rom-com in comparison to others- in the sense that much of it is predictable. However, I quite enjoyed, what for me- delivered more oomph and less caricature like characters than I'd gotten used to from Jimenez. The summer vibes. ☀️🍉🍧⛱️🎡🌊",4

"141","195820807","4.75⭐️ hey, if a book makes me cry on the bus, it's getting 5 stars 😭😭 4 dates, 1 kiss and a break up; just for the summer - or is it?? Justin and Emma think they are under a curse, everyone they date finds their one true love after a break up so they decide that maybe if they dated each other, that would break each other's curse, right? The first book I read by A. Jimenez was Yours Truly and I remember thinking that for a romance writer who leans more towards romcom, she explores too many medical trigger warnings, like maybe it would make sense if were typical contemporary romance because you'd kind of expect that. Her covers get me and I pick them up because I want their romance to make me go ""awww too cute"" just the bright colors and smile a lot more than cry and have my anxiety triggered. I was worried when I read the description and trigger warnings for this book - panic attacks, anxiety, PTSD, depression, depictions of undiagnosed mental health issues, a toxic mother, and past child neglect. This managed to be still very cute and felt like a warm hug after therapy. I loved this storyline so much more. I loved the layers to the characters and the plot as well. It did not at all feel like the triggering contents overwhelmed the romance of the story to me and it had me invested in Justin and Emma, Maddy and Niel and Amber the whole time.***this is as much summer as I'm going to get rn, I'll take it ☀️👙⛱️🌸💛",5
"142","195820807","3.25 Stars ★ “Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”Abby has become an auto buy author for me since I enjoyed both Part of Your World and Yours Truly. However, this one let me down some. Just for the Summer is the third book in the Part of Your World series. What you will find is an online cute meet, dating pact, and some rom-com romance. As this has forced proximity, witty banter, and found family, that's not all. There is also Abby's typical mental health representation that she navigates with care. This had me giggling and kicking my feet to tears streaming down my face. Emma and Justin have something in common they are both essentially known as ""good luck charms."" Everyone they date ends up finding their soulmates once they break up. They come up with a plan to go on for dates, share a kiss, and break up. Their goal is to cancel out the streak and find their soulmates. Emma Grant is a travel nurse who doesn't stay long in one place, and she has her reasons. She is strong and kind-hearted, but don't let that fool you because she has years of emotional damage. Her trauma stems from abandonment and always believing the best in people. She tends to detach and distance herself from everyone when she feels stressed. I'll be honest that I didn't vibe with Emma a lot as she seemed immature to me. That is until all of her baggage started to unravel, and she began to realize why she was the way she was. I loved watching her growth once it started. I just wish that it would have been sooner. ""Why not forgive? In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy."" Justin Dahl is sweet, caring, and funny. He is strong as well, and I can say that I appreciate his character. He goes through so much with changes that are happening to his life that are out of his control, but he deals with them as well as one can. He became a quick second to Jacob for me because, let's face it, Abby knows how to write a mmc that we all love and swoon over, and he is no exception. ""I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this, and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”Emma and Justin started off as insta-love and didn't really move away from that, in my opinion. This is what didn't work for me the most as it's a romance book, and I myself didn't feel it until towards the end. Don't get me wrong, they had their cute moments, but I wanted tension and chemistry. Justin was putting forth into the relationship, but it didn't feel like Emma was, which I can understand in some sense. It just felt very one-sided. I can say that they were good at communicating. The romance made an appearance when Emma caught up to Justin, but I would have liked to feel it much sooner than the last 25%. I did love the surveys that he sent her with options. I am always indecisive, especially on things to do or go eat, and this would help me to choose. “Four dates. A kiss. No breakup.” “Not just for the summer?”“No. Forever this time.” If it's one thing AJ definitely knows how to write, it's the found family. I was eating it up like candy. I loved Maddy and how she kept it so real and told it like it is. It has me excited for her book. The ending was cute, but again, I was a bit disappointed. It felt rushed to me, especially after the conflict that, in a way, it felt necessary for Emma to grow. I just would have liked to see more of them working on any of their issues together as in real life things just don't mend themselves back together magically. I really enjoyed the easter eggs that were sprinkled throughout. A couple of them literally left me with my jaw dropped. While I didn't love this, it was still enjoyable. I look forward to reading more of her work as stated before she has become a favorite. Quotes and favorite moments ""Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.” “Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then, when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks."" “Let’s be very clear here. I am not the obstacle in the way of your happiness. That person is you.” ""Four dates, one kiss, and a breakup. Just for the summer."" “You’re not asking too much,” he said. ""You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.” ""Maddy was like a first responder for my soul. She always had been.

"145","195820807","1.) Part of Your World ★★★★★2.) Yours Truly ★★★★let me preface this entire review by saying that i do believe you should read at least part of your world in this loosely connected series. i didn’t feel like this about yours truly, because you just see overlapping friendships between characters - which is really cool, but i don’t think would hinder any reading experience! But i truly am not sure if i would have given this book five stars, if not for also reading part of your world! so again, totally do whatever you wanna do, read these however you want to read them, but i just recommend reading at least part of your world (which is probably the best romance book i’ve read in years, so it will be a fun side quest, i promise)! now that that is out of the way - let me actually talk about the book itself! The basic premise is that a girl read a reddit post that makes her realize the poster and her have one thing in common: they both are the person people date before they find their soulmates. So emma (28, traveling nurse) slides into justin’s (op, 29, engineer) about this curse they both may have, but then they start talking about other things and realize that they actually have more in common than their nonexistent love lives. they come up with a plan to maybe try to break this spell by dating each other on emma’s next traveling assignment, where she will come to minnesota where justin is at. and maybe, much like another book i loved this year - funny story, justin can convince emma to fall in love with his state, and maybe even want to set up some roots even though she lives a life constantly moving from place to place with her best friend. firstly, i love justin, i love emma, i wish them both the very best in life, but their friends, in particular maddy, oh they have my entire heart. this is a love story, without question, and this has a lot of heavy themes of grief and childhood neglect, but to me, this is a story about friendship, support systems, and being there for the people you love in life, no matter what. from justin’s friends knowing exactly what to do to lightening the weight in his life, to emma’s best friend maddy, who gave her so many different types of love throughout this book and truly is probably the best book friends i’ve ever read about in my life, to justin’s mom’s best friend who makes me cry even thinking about. this is just such a book about showing up for people, and also feeling like you trust people to show up for you, even when others in the past have made you a person who does not trust easily. these themes just really set this book apart for me, and is the reason this will be one of my favorite books of 2024. other things i loved: first dates with kittens!! questionnaires/google forms letting the person know what you like on dates! i know a lot of medical travelers and it was really cool reading a mc who does it! also, accurate med surg stereotype commentary, alongside accurate vegas stereotype commentary lol. you’re never too old to make new connections, and healthy relationships, with respected boundaries (romantically, but also with friends and family and anyone you choose to share your life with)! overall, if you’re looking for a really good romance, following two people healing from their pasts, both together and apart, and truly creating a healthy life for themselves, while also being such a love letter to friendships and all relationships (again, not just romantic ones), then please pick this up. i knew i was going to like this, but i didn’t expect to love it so very much and be impacted by the story so very deeply. and if you need a reminder, you are not the sum of the bad things in your past, especially stuff that was beyond your control. and it’s never too late to get the help, or extra resources, that you deserve. and you always deserve to live a healthier life, surrounded by people who appreciate you and love you unconditionally. lastly, abby - please give us the maddy and doug’s book. I am on my knees writing this review, begging you, please. trigger + content warnings in the front of the book (it also says there should be a full list of more tw/cw on the author’s website and goodreads, which i couldn’t find to link as of august 5th, 2024, but i still always appreciate when they are in books): scenes containing panic attacks, anxiety, ptsd, depression, depictions of undiagnosed mental health issues, a toxic mother, and past child neglect. additional trigger + content warnings i wrote down while reading: talk of loss of father in past (car accident where the other person was drinking and driving), abandonment, abusive parents, neglect in past, child starvation in past, gaslighting, manipulation, a few hospital settings (only because of the profession of one of the mcs), talk of foster systems, grief, a parent going to prison, one sentence regarding suicide, vomit, sickness (norovirus), talk of menstruation, headlice, and talk of loss of grandparents in past. blog | instagram | youtube | kofi | spotify | amazon ♡ The Friend Zone ★★♡ buddy read with betty jo[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",5

"147","60909831","Unpopular opinion: This book was just okay and not worth the hype for me. I desperately wanted this to be a 5-star read! ☹️Before I tell you why this didn’t work for me, let me tell you the things that I did like. •Stevie and Zander. Their chemistry was amazing and I can’t fault that. The banter, the dialogue, everything about them together worked. •Zander’s conversation with his father had me crying. The way his relationship with his father came around… 😢. •Maddison, Logan and their entire family. I need their story!! 😭So, technically this should’ve worked because I’m always interested in the characters first when it comes to a story. And if I like them, I like the book. But that wasn’t the case here. And whilst this had a strong beginning, it started to go downhill for me in the second half. The flaws became far too glaring. 1. There was absolutely no need for it to have been this long. 600 pages? Why? This should’ve been 200 pages shorter or more. 2. I’m not sure if I’m the only one that felt this, but I had a hard time picturing the characters as Black main characters, even though they were. I’m faulting the writing. I pictured them as white the entire time. And when I’m reading a book that includes Black characters, I want to feel that intrinsically. 3. It became repetitive and far too longwinded. By the 70% mark I was ready for it to be over. 😑4. Things got a bit cheesy for my taste towards the end. 5. There was opportunity for more therapy elements to have been incorporated into the story, especially when things went downhill for Zander, but it was missed. Which I don’t understand, since therapy did play a significant role in the story. 6. The third-act conflict dragged. I mean, it dragged! Rolling-my-eyes-dragged. 🙄7. I didn’t understand the role he was forced to play for that long? Probably because I have zero interests in sports. 8. I wish we had more insight with regards to the mental health organisation he ran with his friend, Maddison. I’ll be reading book 2 (but not for a whiiile), since I liked the characters that were introduced and people seem to love it more, but I’m keeping my expectations neutral. But, this won’t be a book I will remember. 😬🤷🏾‍♀️",2

She was my favorite part of the entire book. & Zander is the perfect mix of confident, protective + emotional + hot? idk. amazing. The plus size rep, the diversity, the open conversations about therapy & mental health, the banter, the spice, the romance.. goodbye. 🫶🏻i don’t have a single complaint. the only issue is that it’s over. 😃 also the side characters were amazing!!!! indy? sos. queen. I NEED RYAN’S BOOK NOW.“you following me?” “vee and zee. aren’t we fcking adorable?”",5

"150","60909831","★ 1.75 starsI’M FINALLY FREE!!! this was one of the most boring books i’ve ever read. i wanted to dnf it so many times, but i stubbornly forced myself to finish it — why? i don’t know. guess i was waiting for it to get good, but as you can see, it never did. anyway... let’s get into it. this review is going to be a little long, so buckle up. there are a few spoilers here, so don’t read this review if you don’t want to be spoiled!first, let’s talk about one of my biggest issues with Mile High: the length. this book is over 600 PAGES LONG, and i really can’t see why. that’s extremely unnecessary. Liz Tomforde, with all due respect: get an editor. please! there were multiple scenes that didn’t add anything to the story, so this book could’ve (and should’ve) easily been 250 pages shorter. i don’t know if anyone would agree with me on this, but there’s literally no reason for a contemporary romance to have more than 500 pages. that should be a crime. i mean, i guess some might work if there’s a nice plot and interesting main characters — but that was definitely not the case with this one. the plot was... i’m sorry, is there even a plot? i didn’t feel like there was one. this book is marketed as a hockey romance and yet we had like one scene of the MMC playing hockey if i’m not mistaken. and the main characters were bland, they honestly didn’t interest me that much.Stevie: was she an amazing character? no. but she was not really a terrible character either. there were times that she was funny and bold, and i kind of liked that. there’s also the fact that she’s plus size and i really think the author did a nice job of portraying her insecurities with her body. but, those things aside, there is nothing else to say about her. at the beginning of the book, i thought she had potential to be a great and remarkable character, but she isn’t. as i said, i don’t hate Stevie and i don’t think she’s terrible, but in general, she’s not a character that i’d call interesting. and i have to mention that she was kind of giving i’m not like other girls at times. she drinks beer constantly, only buys thrifted clothes (even though she has money) and uses stained sweatpants and dirty sneakers almost all the time. she’s so different, right? and the weirdest thing is that there’s this scene where she goes out in the street with mustard in her chin — and yes, she’s aware, but she doesn’t even bother to wipe it. like, hello?! Zanders: i was reading a few reviews and i noticed that almost everyone who has read this book is obsessed with this man, so i’m definitely in the minority here. i don’t hate him, but i don’t love him either. well... if i’m being honest, i hated him in the first half. he was absolutely insufferable and annoying at the beginning of the book. i swear, not even 10 pages in and the guy was already pissing me off. instead of explain with my own words, i’m gonna put some quotes here and you’ll understand why he annoyed me so much.
  
    “There’s a different kind of thrill when it comes to pussy on the road. The unknown of who it’ll be, the excitement of where it’ll happen, the satisfaction that I don’t have to see them ever again if I don’t want to. That’s how I like it.”“My Instagram is already flooded with messages from my Tennessee roster, and I can guarantee that if I want, my dick will be buried deep inside one of them tonight.”“Her eyes are probably the most interesting pair I’ve ever seen, and her body is perfectly full, with plenty to grab onto. But unfortunately, her pretty outside that I like is tainted by the attitude I don’t like.”“Why doesn’t she want to talk to me?Just being honest here, I’ve never had someone refuse my attention.”
  
sir, you’re a grown ass adult, act like one.
  
    “She might need a reminder that she’s working for me, but I’ll make sure she understands. I’m petty that way. I’ll remember that little interaction for as long as she’s on my airplane.”
  
mind you, this was just because in their first interaction he assumed she wanted an autograph, but she actually didn’t, so he got offended. how pathetic. 🙄the worst in my opinion is that he had a list of all the the women he’s slept with in his notes app — and it was organized by city. it gets worse: he also described what they were like sexually. that’s beyond weird.
  
    “Apparently, Carrie was a great lay with a fantastic rack, and Ashley gave one hell of a blowjob.”
  
but hey! apparently, he’s not a misogynistic asshole who doesn’t care about women! it was actually a PR stunt! shocking.
  
    “People eat this shit up. We play it up for the media, but the truth is I’m not the piece of shit people think I am. I care about a lot more than just the women I take home from the arena.”
  
his agent pushed this narrative to make him gain more money and popularity, and it worked pretty well. he also needs to maintain this “playboy image” because he’s convinced it’ll help him get his contract renewed with the Chicago Raptors, the hockey team he plays for.
  
    “Whenever you’re ready to let people know you’re not the dickhead they all think you are, you let me know, and we’ll stop the act.”“Nah, I’m still enjoying it,” I tell him honestly. “I gotta get that renewed contract by the end of the season, so until then, we have to keep it going.”
  
to be fair, i don’t know why the author came up with this lame storyline. it doesn’t even make sense, why would his hockey team use his personal life to determine whether or not to renew his contract? be so for real. yeah, we discover at the end that it was all a lie from his agent, but still. and he might not be the bad boy that the media paints him to be — but he’s far from a saint.he gets “better” (less insufferable) after a few chapters, which is obviously predictable so i don’t know why i’m saying this. and, even though i’m not Zander’s biggest fan, i can admit that there was a few nice things about his character:1. he’s a co-founder of a charity foundation that supports underprivileged young athletes who don’t have the mental health resources they need.2. the bare minimum, i know — but he never made Stevie feel insecure, and he was always worshipping her and trying to help her with her insecurities.3. Stevie volunteered at a senior dog shelter, and there was this doberman there, Rosie, who had been there for almost a year. even though Stevie loved Rosie, she couldn’t adopt her because she was living with her brother who was allergic, but Zanders ended up adopting her. i found that really sweet. he also made a big and helpful donation to the shelter.4.. he had a cute relationship with his best friend/teammate’s child, Ella. we didn’t get much scenes of them together but i enjoyed the ones we got.and that’s about it. the romance left much to be desired. did Stevie and Zanders had cute moments throughout the book? yes, and they had a bit of chemistry too. but overall, i felt like their relationship was lacking something. it wasn’t captivating, it wasn’t very well executed and sometimes gave me major ✨wattpad✨ vibes, they had so many cringe scenes i won’t even bother to quote them here. and there wasn’t enough buildup in my opinion, not even 15% in and they were already lusting over each other, and they slept together at 27%. it was so rushed. and there’s a third act breakup, which i don’t like, i mean, who does? and it dragged on for too long. their relationship was going well, but for a stupid reason he decided to break up things with her at 75% — so we had more than 120 pages of unnecessary drama and pathetic scenes that could’ve been avoided if they just communicated to each other. but of course, they don’t know how to do that! the lack of communication between them made me struggle so hard to read the last few chapters. seriously, imagine how tired i was.all in all, i did not enjoy this book, not even a bit. i’m extremely disappointed because i had high expectations after seeing a lot of people loving it. i guess it was just not for me. i’ve heard the second book is way better than this one — it’s about Indy Ivers (Stevie’s friend) and Ryan Shay (Stevie’s brother). however, i’m not really sure if i’ll give it a chance. i liked Indy, she was a funny character, and Ryan seemed to be a nice guy, but i’m not excited to read their story. let’s see if i’ll change my mind eventually.",2
"151","60909831","what an utter disappointment and I blame all of you who hyped this book up for me.. hero has a notes app where he rates his sexual partners across the country so he knows who to pick for hookup when he is visiting those cities for his games but he is in therapy we are reminded of it a lot, which I am a little suspicious, ten years of therapy dude you are owed some kind of refund because it is not looking good... and heroine and her small work clothes because her weight is fluctuating, also something we are reminded of all the time, you know she has to be squeezed into her clothes, there is no chance for her to I don't know, get bigger size but don't worry she is not like other girls with her constant fast food eating and hanging out in ratty sweats listen, if you want long-winded repetitive sports romance with not any storyline regarding sports and romance between man whore hero and pick me heroine well, then sure read this book...",1
"152","60909831","“You following me?” A light laugh flows through him. “You have no idea, Stevie girl.”
This is definitely one of the best sports romance I have ever read. I get easily bored when it comes to this genre but I really enjoyed this book a lot even if it is 600 plus pages long. Yes, it could've been atleast 50 to 80 pages short but Stevie and Zanders were just so cute that I didn't wanted to stop reading about them. This book is a perfect balance of cute, wholesomeness, emotional and heartwarming moments.
  “So, ‘Vee’, huh?” “It’s a family nickname.”  “My family nickname is Zee. Vee and Zee. Aren’t we fucking adorable?
The starting was amazing with stevie being such a badass to Zanders and not giving a shit about his public image. Their banter was top notch, the sexual tension was hot, their obsession with each other had me swooning. Everything was great except that third-act breakup. I also loved the found family moments of Zander and Madison's family. The way they both cared for each other and their families. I really need to read Madison and Logan's book!
  “Oh fuck. My heart. The words. The girl. It all makes my heart race.”“Stevie girl, I’ll follow you anywhere.”“You’re my first choice, Vee. My only choice.”
➸ Stevie Shay She's such a badass girl with the most kind and selfless personality. I loved everything about her. Her insecurities about her body and her career were so real and heartbreaking. The author did an amazing job writing a plus size heroine who's also bold but also a bit insecured about herself and how others see her and Stevie's growth was slow but realistic.It's not that she didn't love herself—she did loved herself but it was other's opinions about her body that get to her especially her mother's. She also hated being her brother's shadow and always wanted someone to know her and love her for her only and Zanders is that person for her. I liked how she developed confidence about her body and how Zanders was there to help her and love her on her bad days. 
  “You don’t have to love your body every single day. That’s unrealistic to expect, but I’ll be here loving it for the days you can’t.”
➸ Evan ZandersI kinda hated him in the start. I mean he was behaving like this playboy and territorial man but his character grew up on me as the story progressed. He hides his real self behind this playboy facade of “new girl, new day” but behind all that he's just a sweet, kind-hearted and caring man who would anything for his found family and his little niece even if it means dressing up as Elsa for Halloween. Zanders had abandonment issues that's why he never showed his real self to his fans, he thinks he's not lovable because his own mother left him. He loved himself but he never let anyone love him until Stevie. I liked his character development and how he tried to make things right with his father and how he dealt with his insecurities.
  “You'll always be my first choice. Have been since the day I met you, sweetheart.”
╰┈➤ Stevie & ZandersStevie and Zanders are perfect for each other. Stevie who was never anyone's first choice, first option and Zanders who never had anyone in his life who could love him unconditionally. Zanders who made her his first and his only choice and Stevie who loves him with all her heart. I loved how Zanders made sure she felt comfortable in her body, complemented her, praised her, loved her and worshipped her. And the mirror scene where she told him all the insecurities she has about her body and he tells he loves all of her was just so precious and beautiful. He was so fixated on her the moment they met and the way he always tried to get a rise out of her because Stevie didn't give a shit about him being an NHL player. Zanders won my heart when he tried to follow her to her apartment late at night and they weren't even friends at that time but he just wanted to protect her. 
  “I fell in love with you while we were miles high in the air, and im begging you to love me back.”
The ending felt like it was dragged on for long. That third-act breakup was way too long for my liking and it's one of the major issues for my 4 stars raring for this book. The breakup was reasonable and needed for Zander to finally reconcile with his father and his abandonment issues and I liked how everything was ended. I can't wait to read about them in the next books because I think I am a little obsessed with Vee and Zee and this series! Can't wait for Ryan's book because he's already my favourite man in this series!“I love road games.” — Zanders in chapter 1“I hate road games.” — Zanders in epilogue",4
"153","60909831","It was okay, but nothing I have not read before. Am kinda conflicted as there were parts I did enjoy, and parts I did not care about. Starting with the  writing-  it was average, a bit like The Fine Print, the characters' traits, the dialogues and the tone of the book heavily reminded me of that. It easily could have been a minimum of 200 pages short. It was  too wordy  at times and I was tempted to skim. It started off meh, had a strong middle and then the third act breakup messed it up. Although what interestingly worked was the  pace  of the book, it was fast which I appreciated. Coming to the  characters- Stevie and Zanders.  They were meh, quite forgettable tbh. As individuals they do not shine, especially Stevie. Tho I did appreciate the author bringing out her insecurities, vulnerability, there was not much else to her. She was the love interest to Zanders. Zanders gave the typical ""I'm not like other guys"" vibes on and off throughout the book. It's his personality conflict that makes him a very inconsistent character. He does have his sweet moments tho, which I liked. The  supporting characters-  Indy, was the most annoying character in this book for me. The way she talks is just so damn immature, it irked me a lot. Maddison and his whole family were sweet. Ryan is another character I liked. The  romance  started off strongly insta lusty, which I was not a fan of. Considering it is a 600+ pages book, a slow burn would have worked far better. The chemistry between Stevie and Zanders starts off rocky due to the  insta lust,  it felt forced. Towards the middle, when things slow down and they take the time to get to know each other, that's when I liked the two as a couple. The moments where the two encourage each other and support the honest and open communication was something I liked. The sexual tension is okay-ish. The  spice  is well written. Okay, this might sound am nitpicking but I hated their nicknames for each other, Zee and Vee 🤢 I just did not vibe with the nicknames at all, especially whenever Zanders called her ""Stevie girl,"" like the first 3-4 times it was okay, but soon turned to be too much. The  third act breakup  was so petty, it just came across as the author wrote it for the sake of it. The ending was sweet tho. Overall, an okay-ish read, too overhyped imo.~•~•~Bro why is this book 600+ pages long",3
"154","60909831","i definitely get the hype with this one!it was a super real romance which can be surprisingly hard to find. but the hockey playing hero with a bad reputation had a lot of heart and defied playboy tropes. and our heroine with body confidence issues was also incredibly strong and confident in other aspects of her life. i liked the inclusion of family relationships (because in real life those definitely DO affect your romantic relationships) and i surprisingly didn't mind that things started with a simple hookup.if you're looking for a rock solid hockey romance and are willing to overlook the slightly clunky writing at the beginning, this is something you need to pick up.",4
"155","60909831","if he doesn't worship me the way Zanders worships Stieve I DON'T WANT HIM!!😩😩also, i apparently manifested the thing I posted as an update yesterday so I won't give this one 5!!but omg i loved this one SO MUCHHHHH!😩----------------------------Been dying to read this series !! 603 pages and 17 hrs audiobook, wish me luck guyssss😭🤞",4
"156","60909831","We could've saved so many trees if only Zanders kept his mouth shut 🤗🤗Listen, this book was far from bad. I would’ve rated it higher (about 3.5-4 stars) if it weren’t for the MANY ISSUES it had. 💔OVERALL THOUGHTS I saw so many people raving about this book all over the Internet. Naturally, the easily influenced person I am🤡, it didn’t take much convincing before I decided to pick it up. And I WAS DESPERATE TO LOVE IT. I needed a quality romance book. BOY, was I in for a ride! We started off strong, a good story, GOOD WRITING, a loveable female main character. But everything went downhill a bit too soon.🤷🤷 Dear white authors, DON’T WRITE BLACK CHARACTERS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERSITY IF YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO WRITE THEM WELL! If I took a shot every time I read “wild girl”, “wild curls”, “wild hair”, I WOULD BE PLASTERED BY PAGE 10. There was absolutely nothing wild about this woman, come up with a different adjective please! YOU ARE A NORMAL REGULAR CIVILIAN, ACT LIKE IT! What’swild about a head full of curls? And if it was mentioned once or twice, I would have tolerated it, but it was at least 5 times on every single page.🤷🤷Which brings me to my next point, THIS BOOK IS 600 PAGES LONG. That is INSANE for a contemporary romance. But yk, (unlike me) some (fictional) people have eventful lives so I can excuse that if THINGS HAPPEN. But they don’t really, we just drag and drag and drag the story that consists of “hazel eyes”, “beautiful man”, “wild girl”, “blue-green eyes”, “curly-haired flight attendant” and filler words in-between those. The amount of frustration. If the editor got rid of these repetitions, this book would have been 400 pages long max (which is still pretty long but we’ll get to that soon).Next point, Zanders was INSUFFERABLE. I’m sorry, but y’all will have to stand up at some point (make it soon).🤭 Like, for sure, he has redeeming qualities about him, like, I can genuinely (based on his actions but without spoiling anything) see that he’s a good kind man with morals (who would’ve thought) BUT THE ONLY PLACE HE SHOULD BE IS THE NEAREST KINDERGARTEN! The things that came out of this man’s mouth...my jaw dropped on several occassions. These things weren’t that wild (pun intended) per se, but in context... girl! Calling someone’s sweatpants disgusting? Shaming someone for thrift shopping? Calling the most normal woman ever a WILD GIRL after knowing her for 50 seconds? Sir, Imma need you to shut up. Being immature isn’t hot (that’s my 2023 campaign). 🤠(Before you attack me, ""giving shit a person you like"" is not how adults act).The romance was actually really good. I loved Stevie and Zanders together. They had a genuine well developed connection. Their conversations were believable. This book had so many cute and romantic scenes which were so well written. Again, I can’t believe how well-written this was and how it had a good storyline, but at the same time so many beginner-level mistakes that destroyed everything (for me), including the rating. The spice was also good, BUT SO MUCH OF IT (okay maybe I’m exaggerating a bit). It wasn’t every other page, but could’ve been reduced considering the fact that it brought absolutely nothing to the table. Except for their first time, every other time it happened was unnecessary. I’m not being a prude, but if you’re putting those scenes there to fill the pages, I’m not gonna be too happy about that. The last 40-50 pages drove me absolutely insane. PLEASE WRAP UP THE BOOK WOMAN! I miss the goodold “they lived happily ever after”. But no, we needed to know what Prada present Zanders got for a 1 y/o. CHARACTERSSTEVIE soloed. This woman carried the book on her back. I loved absolutely everything about her. Except the obvious, I must mention the one thing I loved especially. I love how the author dealt with Stevie’s insecurities surrounding her weight. Without spoiling much, that bathroom breakdown scene was BEAUTIFUL. Also, when those comments surfaced, nothing was mentioned too explicitly so it wouldn’t trigger anyone, but still, the message was delivered very well (including the characters’ emotions etc). ❤️❤️Stevie was a 3D character, she had a nice personality, hobbies, interests, personal struggles, I volunteer to be her friend. ZANDERS yeah. In order not to repeat myself, I will mention a few more things here. He ate a few times, with a few comments, I’m not gonna lie, that “Stevie girl” had me putting a few strands of hair behind my ear. Also, this man did show some character development throughout the book, I have to give him that. We ended on good terms, but overall, I’m good you can have him. SIDE CHARACTERS. I love them all without exception. They made this book realistic and fun. Which leads me to my conclusion, I have a feeling that Ryan’s book will be much better than this one. He was such a babygirl in this book, IN LOVE. LIZ TOMFORDE, YOU’RE GOOD, I’M WAITING FOR YOU TO BE GREAT! 🤠❤️💅(Don’t take anything I’ve said here too seriously pls, I’m critiquing this book based solely on how I felt reading it. Feel free to start a respectful discussion and to correct me if I got something wrong)💋💋",3
"157","60909831","DNF p.g 87I was listening to the audiobook while reading along on my kindle and in the audiobook the mixed race FMC’s hair is constantly referred to as “crazy” “wild” & “untameable” in this 2022/2023 a white author thought it was ok to write about a hair type she doesn’t have in a negative light!

"158","60909831","3.75★s Public announcement: I am incredibly sorry for how long it has taken me to pick up this series. I will now likely devour the rest of them within 3-4 days. Thank you.🙂‍↕️✧“I like you for you”“I know. You’re practically obsessed with me.”✧I have put this off forever and ever. It never really intriguing me even though I've seen so much love for it. I'm so happy I finally decided to give it a shot, because I had an amazing time.Especially in the first half. The glints in their eyes when challenging each other, their natural banter combined with a genuine connection and incredible sexual tension. Them finally giving into one another. LOVE.✦“I look down at my own outfit-my black wool coat, black tailored slacks and black Louboutins, registering it as the moment I fell a little harder.”✦I loved the depth to both Zander and Stevie. They're complex and human, not only those 2-dimensional characters with only two traits that are being played off time and time again.They're authentic. At times it was frustrating reading about how their insecurities self-sabotage for them in life, relationship and hinder them from living their fullest lives. But I can understand where they come from, and I think that is part of what makes this so great.✧“She exposed the missing pieces in my life while simultaneously putting them all together.”✧Mostly, I read this with a big goofy smile on my lips. They are truly so adorable together.I particularly loved how Zander was protective over her mental health, helping her in standing up for herself and see her worth. Whilst she did the same for Zander, loving him unconditionally and being steadfast in that. They are so fully and completely right for one another. I love them. 🥹Over to why this doesn't have a higher rating. I loved every second of the first half. The second half dragged a lot for me however. This definitely could've been 100-200 pages shorter. We received several cute, fluffy moments that simply weren't necessary to their connection as well as a resolution went on for way too long. Liz teased us time and time again with moments where you thought they'd communicate and figure things out, however each time they just found a new issue that needed to be resolved. It all felt a bit too cheesy and forced for my taste. Especially, when their love for one another was so incredibly transparent. I will say, I can appreciate the mmc being self-aware and action-oriented, taking concrete steps to work on himself for the success of their relationship. Another two smaller things, that I wouldn't say impacted my overall enjoyment much but I am getting a bit tired of reading about. 1) The player boy persona. Personally, I feel jaded with men speaking about women and female bodies as if they're just simply properties, something to use. I know it's played up for the sake of the story, for us to be able to see a development in the mmc etc but it didn't hit me right.2) The narrative that women are the emotional and irrational ones.“Women, I tell you. They’re all a little nutty.”, “I don’t do crying. Correction-I don’t do chicks crying.” - Again, I get that these quotes play into his whole playboy aura. That he doesn't have experience with women's emotions, but I'm sick of men thinking these kind of jokes are okay. I know we don't read these books for their feminist takes(lol), so I won't go on a tangent about this, but these are things that stuck out to me whilst reading that I didn't particularly love. ✦“You’re my personal version of heaven, Stevie girl.”✦All in all, this was an amazing read, even if it was a bit too lengthy I had a great time and I am eagerly starting The Right Move now.Windy City #1 - Mile High ReviewWindy City #2 - The Right Move ReviewWindy City #3 - Caught Up ReviewWindy City #4 - Play Along Review____________⌞Pre-read:⌝🤫 I know I have three other books marked as current reads(lets not even talk about the one I started two months ago).

  my thoughts:
Changed my rating a lot but finally after almost a month I decided to do the review, I was honestly going to give this 3 stars but after reading the whole series I upgraded my rating for this one<3I enjoyed this book a lot, I’m a huge hockey romance fan so it’s not a surprise, this has been on my tbr since 2022 and i don’t know why I never read it honestly I refused to read a book this long on my phone so I finally caved in and bought the whole series and I’m glad that I did because I feel that it’s going to be one of my favorite series. One thing I loved about this book was how it highlighted the vulnerabilities of the characters. Liz’s writing did an amazing job portraying their insecurities and showing how these struggles impacted their everyday lives. It made the characters feel more realistic and relatable.There’s something about sports romance combined with the found family trope that always seems to work perfectly, and this book was not the exception. The way Zanders and the Maddison family cared for and supported each other was truly beautiful, adding a deeper layer of warmth and connection to the book.➳ 
  characters:
ೃ࿐ Stevie ꒰🛩꒱ ⭑.ᐟ “She’s an interesting mix of soft and firm. Insecure and confident. Bold and shy”Stevie is working as a private flight attendant for the Chicago hockey team, because of her past experiences she doesn’t want anything to do with an athlete which makes her initially wary of Xander and his reputation as a playboy. She’s not easily impressed by fame or wealth, and her focus is on her career and maintaining her boundaries. While she's tough on the outside, Stevie also has a compassionate side and cares deeply for those she allows into her inner circle. As someone who has been fighting with her weight and confidence, I relate a lot to Stevie, her way of thinking, the way she feels most of the time and her problem with her mother. I think she is one of the characters I’ve related the most lately. ೃ࿐ Zanders ꒰🏒꒱ ⭑.ᐟ “I’m afraid that if everyone sees the real me, that maybe they won’t like it”Zanders is a charismatic professional hockey player. He is known for his undeniable talent on the ice but also for his bad-boy reputation off it. Because of how the media portrayed him he usually hides his vulnerability and personal issues and only shows it to those close to him. Obviously I didn’t like him at the begging, he was the typical playboy who doesn’t want to settle down with anyone and is living his life partying and being carefree. He grew on me the more I kept reading, as the story progressed we could see his softer and caring side. I liked a lot how he gave Stevie her confidence back. ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥˚✿ °. Stevie & Zanders꒰⊹Vee & Zee⊹꒱I absolutely love their relationship; they truly needed each other to become the best versions of themselves. What I appreciate most about them is that, even though their connection began with physical attraction, it didn’t stop them from forming a deep emotional bond. I adore how they took their time to truly get to know each other on a deeper level. It feels rare nowadays, as so many books focus more on the mc’s dynamics in bed, letting lust overshadow love. Their emotional growth together is what makes their relationship so special to me.Stevie longed to be someone’s first choice, and that’s exactly how Zanders made her feel.🥹Zanders had always feared that if anyone truly saw who he was, they would leave but Stevie showed him that he was perfect just as he is.
  “You’re my first choice, Vee. My only choice”
My favorite scene between them was the mirror one😭💖 it was so precious. 
  “You don’t have to love your body every single day. That’s unrealistic to expect, but I’ll be here loving it for the days you can’t”
 ༶•┈┈୨♡୧┈┈•༶I had a good time reading this but I also have a few complaints about the book and the reasons why I didn’t gave it 5 stars: the first one is how long it is, this could have been perfectly done with at least hundred pages less. Another thing that I didn’t like was the whole media persona of Zanders, I feel that it was too repetitive and dragged the topic to the end of the book which lowered my enjoyment. 🎧ྀི

  “You want to be chosen first? Well, so do I. So, choose me.”
ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ steviei adore vee so much 🥹🩷
  ”I like bringing her to the expensive dark side, but let’s be real. Stevie, at her core, will always be the thrift-store-loving, shelter-volunteering, baggy-jeans-and-dirty-Air-Force-wearing girl that I’m obsessed with.”“This photo is just the back of her. It’s just a figure in a coat. They can’t see her blue-green eyes that make me weak in the knees every time the corners of them crinkle from her laughter. They can’t see the freckles that decorate her cheeks, the same ones that create patterns and shapes I’ve memorized. They can’t see her smile that melts me every time it beams. On top of that, no photo will ever show her wit. Her sense of humor. Her wild charm or her overwhelmingly open and kind heart. No picture will ever show how sweet she is.”
need i say more?!! anyway, i was incredibly proud when she eventually learned to love herself with zanders' constant compliments and reassurance, and when she stood up to her mom and the public.ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ zandersZANDERS, THE MAN YOU AREEE 😫 i didn’t like his cocky and egoistic attitude initially, but he definitely changed for the better after meeting vee, and i grew to love him after getting to know him on a deeper level. 
  “He loves hard and cares about his people like you wouldn’t believe. So, there’s nothing about him that needs to change. He just needs someone to accept who he is and appreciate what he brings to the table.”
it broke my heart to see him feel pressured to live up to his 'bad boy' image out of fear that no one would love his true self, but i’m so proud that he eventually embraced and showed his true self to the public with vee’s support 🥲
  “Being vulnerable and authentic is scary, man. Terrifying. But to the people who matter to you, the ones you’ve shown your true self to, they love you unconditionally. Why not let others love you unconditionally too? At least give them a chance to.”
ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ stevie and zandersvee and zee are so freaking cute together (they even have matching nicknames) 😭 i loved how they helped each other face their insecurities/trauma and realize they are loveable 🥹
  “I like you, Vee, and I’m being completely honest and vulnerable here. I just want the chance for you to want me. The real me.”“…Thanks for being my girlfriend.” “You don’t have to thank me. It’s the best decision I ever made.”“Thank you for choosing me.”“It’s the best decision I ever made.”

  “What makes them perfect? Because of their clothing size? That doesn’t make someone perfect. And regardless of size, looking like everyone else is boring. You’re stunning, Vee, and what makes you different is what makes you stand out. In the best way possible.”
i saw it coming and get that it was necessary for the plot, but i really didn’t appreciate the third-act breakup 😔↔️
  “Do you love me? Because I love you, Stevie. I’ve always loved you. I just didn’t know that’s what it was at the time. I’ve never had someone to love, and no one has ever loved me the way you do. You might be done with me, Vee, and I wouldn’t blame you if you were, but I can’t let this end without telling you how much I fucking love you. The biggest mistake I’ve ever made was letting you go. I told myself I was doing it to protect you, but I was scared. No one had ever loved me enough to stick around, and I was tired of being left, so I did it before you could. But Stevie, there hasn’t been a second that’s gone by that I haven’t regretted that decision. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Always will be. I thought the scariest thing would be losing Chicago, losing my fans, but I was wrong. The scariest thing is losing you. All this time, I thought I needed an entire city to love me, but the reality is I just need you one person to. I need you to love me. You’ve always been my first choice, Vee, and I lost sight of that for a moment, but I promise you, you’ll never have to question your place in my life again. If you want to be in Seattle, then I’ll try my hardest to play in Seattle. If you want to move somewhere else, then I’m coming too. Stevie girl, I’ll follow you anywhere. I used to love life on the road, because for a moment I could forget I didn’t have anyone at home. But the only reason I enjoyed traveling this season is because you were there. I had the best part of home with me. I fell in love with you while we were a mile high in the air.”“Miles”“What?”“Miles. Like seven miles in the air.”“Sweetheart. I’m kind of having a moment here.””I’m sorry. Please continue.” “Thank you. Anyway, as I was saying. I fell in love with you while we were miles high in the air, and I’m begging you to love me back. I’ll believe you, Stevie. I promise I will. Whatever you say, I’ll believe you. Do you still love me? Do you still love me, Stevie?”“Of course, I do. I’ve always loved you. I just wanted you to let me. I could never give up on you. I love you.”“I love you so much, Vee.”
 I’M NOT CRYING… 😭😭😭😭😭
  “Mine.” “And you’re mine, sweetheart. None of this was right without you. You’re my first and only choice, Vee, and never again am I going to make you feel like you’re not. Fucking love you. I’ll follow you anywhere, Stevie.”
 ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ other charactersit was incredibly moving to see how zanders was a part of madison and logan’s family. they understood him the most (aside from vee) and loved him unconditionally.i despise both stevie’s and zanders’ moms. stevie’s mom was awful, constantly body-shaming and criticizing her. i’m glad she eventually realized the impact of her words and started to make amends, though i’m not too sure why it took her THAT long 🙄 on the other hand, i was so proud of zanders for reconnecting with his dad and cutting his mom out of his life to heal from his trauma 🥹 overall, i really enjoyed stevie and zanders’ story ~ i’m not too sure whether i’ll read caught up though… i’ve never read a “single dad” trope book before and am a bit hesitant ngl… ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ other quotes and dialogues i loved from this book
  “You’re not an idiot. You’re not crazy for wanting to be wanted. For wanting to be loved.”“People like that are going to treat you like you’re not enough or you’re not worthy, but that’s their own insecurities coming out. They’re bullies, and they’ll stop when you make them stop. If you start loving yourself, their words will no longer have meaning.”“You deserve good things, but you’ve got to accept them when they come into your life.”“The right people, the ones who deserve to be in your life, they’re going to accept you for exactly who you are.”

"163","60909831","4.5 stars Mile High is my first book by Liz Tomforde and I loved it so much! Zanders and Stevie were so much fun together- their banter was top notch and their chemistry was out of this world. Stevie (Vee) is a flight attendant and Evan Zanders (Zee) plays professional hockey. She is the permeant flight attendant for the hockey season and the fraternization policy means the players are off limits. Zee is the enforcer for Chicago, the bad boy, the player. But deep down, he has a lot of love to give and is a big softie. I loved watching him fall for Stevie and even more, I loved watching her gain confidence and love herself. Zee was so into her and it was obvious how much he cared. He never made her question her worth. 
  
    “You’re my first choice, Vee. My only choice.”“I’m so into you. It’s ridiculous,”
  
I love sports romance and enemies to lovers and this one was such a win for me! Honestly, the only thing that kept it from being a 5 star read is the fact that it was a little too long for me and I felt there were some repetitive things that could have been cut. The story itself was fantastic. And my favorite side character (Ryan- Vee's twin brother and NBA player) gets a book next so you know I'm going to be reading that ASAP!",4

  “And you’re not an option, Stevie, because besides you, there’s no other choice.”
Stevie was such a queen who is so relatable. I loved her attitude. Zanders was such a vulnerable softie. I loved their chemistry and banter so much. All the “are you following me?” moments. I loved Madison’s family and his friendship with Zanders. I also loved the sibling’s relationship between Vee and Ryan. Even if I still question how he was so oblivious about what happened with his sister and ex-boyfriend. I liked how it was shown how both of their families affected them in a way. The conflict could’ve been done in a better way, but other than that I really enjoyed the story. So looking forward to Indy and Ryan’s story!! Those two already got me swooning!",4

"169","60909831","3.75 ★wow... that was quite a ride.i absolutely loved the MC's, and almost everything about this story. the reasons i didn't rate this higher is because it's no different than any other hockey romance book. i definitely still ate it up, but it's not unique at all. i absolutely also loved how the FMC was insecure. i'm insecure, and also curvy myself so to see the way xanders loved her despite how she felt about her body, even made her like herself - truly warmed my heart.i also related to xanders on a level - with panic attacks that happen to me occasionally, seeing xanders go through that was absolutely heartbreaking. i wish we had more clarity on how those were handled after he handled the situation with his mother.i'd definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!! it's really good and my heart was breaking during the book and i absolutely loved it even more when it was put back together 🤭br with kyrie 💗",4
"170","60909831","5 stars. This was surprisingly one of the best sport romance books I’ve read this year. Tbh the book checked all the boxes.The tension between them ? Check.The characters development of both of them through it all ? Check, check.The relationships between their respective families, plus all the drama around, and all the cute ”Uncle Zander”persona? Check, check, check.And the little vibe of ennemis to lovers mixed with the perfect amount of forbidden romance ? GAH ! CHECK, CHECK. I’m a sucker for a plus size heroine who speaks her mind fearlessly, and in this case I absolutely loved Steve.",5
"171","60909831","Absolutely one of my favorite books of 2023 and it will be for the rest of the year! Are you kidding me!? I loved Zee from the moment we met him. He was definitely a player and had a girl waiting for him in every city his hockey team when to. But the moment he saw Stevie!? I love how hard he fell and how much he loved to push her buttons. And Stevie has been one of my favorite heroines I've read. She's a curvy heroine and has some insecurities because of her ex. But her brother is a professional basketball player, so celebrities don't phase her, especially Zee. They're interactions were perfect and I loved how hard they both fell for each other. This is a forbidden romance too, though, because if they are caught together, Stevie would lose her job. I just love a good sports romance and I loved Zee and his teammates. The mental health importance was so good, too, and I loved how important that was to Zee. The ending was also so emotional and so good!!! And the dogs!? I just loved everything about this book and you have to read it!",5
"172","60909831","2.5 - Typical sports romance! Definitely going to continue the series because everyone has said the 2nd and 3rd books get better and better! Too long in some parts and like I said before, the amount of times the author referenced his money and her weight was just way too much.",2

"176","60909831","4.5 ⭐️I’m happy to say that I very much loved this book. I connected to the characters right away, felt like they were fully formed and complex, I loved their banter, their chemistry, I loved the build up and the way the whole story developed - I really think it was done very well and I had a great time reading it. I did feel like it was longer than it needed to be, and since I’ve read so many books similar to this in the past, it felt extremely predictable to me - but I really liked both characters and enjoyed watching their story unfold, so it didn’t end up bringing down my enjoyment for it.There are some small things that had me rolling my eyes throughout the book that aren’t really worth mentioning… so the only real issue I want to point out is the third act breakup and everything that happened in the last 150 pages. I saw it coming from a mile away, it felt unnecessary and could have easily gone in a completely different direction that would have strengthened their relationship instead of doing the exact opposite, and most of all… I felt like it was the worst situation to happen to them based off of everything the characters were so vocal about during the rest of the book. I didn’t like seeing their biggest issues and insecurities being used against them… even if it all worked out fine by the end. In the past I’ve let third act breakups slide when I enjoyed the rest of the book as much as I did… and even though I loved this one just as much (if not more) than Consider Me which had a very similar premise/storyline (and I had given 5 stars to at the time), I don’t want to be as nice anymore. Third act breakups don’t have to be the norm & could easily be replaced by something different/more unique - so docking half a star for that last lil bit.",4

— firstly, i’m the most indecisive person ever and i couldn’t settle on a rating for the life of me. i was so excited to read this story, like the gorgeous cover INSTANTLY drew me in and i was so stoked when i got approved for the arc but this book was just so boring and it ended up falling short for me.. i ended up skimming the last 20% bc i just wanted it to be over. i felt no connection between these characters. how was ford pining for rosie for decades but he hasn’t seen her in 10 years.. that’s why it all felt so forced to me, why didn’t he make his move earlier on if he “loved” her so much. he also kept having to repeat that he’s always pined for her ever since they were young. like who was he trying to convince that he’s always loved her, us or himself? bc i wasn’t buying it bc there is absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever. there was also no angst, tension or buildup + the will they/won’t they was so exhausting, it was going on for way too long and the bickering was kind of immature. ford and rosie are probably the most blandest couple i’ve read about in a while. **spoilers below**➳ ford grant:the most down bad man ever and a former geek who turned into a billionaire?? oh wait.. “worlds boring hottest billionaire” okay slay ig. i loved how shy and awkward he would get around rosie and how he wore her diary key around his neck but his character was so boring. idk if it was because he was written way too perfectly but his pov would put me to sleep 😭 it was pissing me off how he kept implying that he started from nothing even tho he is a nepo baby. i thought this was supposed to be a single dad romance but a 12 year old just randomly shows up at his front door and drops the “my dad died, my mom is now depressed.. oh, and i’m your daughter btw” card on him bc he donated sperm at 19 as he needed $100 for concert tickets. their first interaction was also ??? why are you saying to a 12 year old that you “never fucked morticia addams” and then she responds with: “what about a paper dixie cup?” she continues. “a petri dish? a sterile tube? you fuck any of those for a few bucks at any point in your life?” um sorry, what?? what 12 year old is talking like that lmaoo. the way it’s worded you would expect that from a 16 year old, not from a literal child. also why was everyone talking to cora like she was a grown adult. i also found it weird how her mother just handed her off to a literal stranger so easily.. it did kind of bug me that ford would refer to cora as his daughter bc she had her OWN family he was just a random sperm donor. you’re also trying to tell me that cora has no relatives?? NOT EVEN ONE?? lol anyways. i did admire cora and ford’s vulnerable moments, it was rly sweet to read about. she literally looks at him like he hung the moon and stars. ➳ rosalie belmont:idk what it was about her character but she just irked me so much. you know that feeling whenever someone talks and you just constantly want to roll your eyes bc they are pissing you off?? yeah that’s how i felt reading her pov. she literally has a bf but she strings him along for half of the book even though she has feelings for ford?? 🤡 like girl why are you still with that man when you both don’t even have feelings for each other and you both act like you are friends rather than romantic partners.. you could’ve easily dumped him when you moved back to rose hill. and then when she does finally break up with him and that man is literally in tears she says “i can tell he’s sad, but if I’m being honest, i’m not especially worried about ryan being okay. instead, i’m stressed by the fact that ford isn’t.” WHY IS FORD MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION?? mans just got dumped and you’re more worried about ford just bc YOUR bf who you decided not to break up with shows up unannounced.. i can promise you fords’ feelings was not more important in this situation. was it rly necessary for rosie to be in a relationship? absolutely not, it was useless, they didn’t even speak to each other. she is also constantly referred to as “bitchy” and “bratty” and i feel like she just took that and ran with it.. girlypop being a bitch isn’t a personality trait and isn’t the serve you think it is. was this why she didn’t have any friends?? it was probably just me but i felt like she written to be like willa 2.0. even tho i didn’t connect w her character i did love her relationship with cora and that she was always there for her. the third act break up or third act drama bc idk wtf that was 90% into the book was completely unnecessary. was it thrown in for shock value?? who knows but it was absolutely ridiculous bc they made up so quick. i wish authors would stop doing that bc it just drags a book out when it should’ve been over. this was also a reason that detracted my overall enjoyment of this story. *regarding the sexual harassment, i wish it was touched on more!! rosie is sexually harassed by her previous boss who was in a position of power but then she starts a sexual relationship with ford who is also in a position of power since he’s her new boss. i wish they would’ve spoke about boundaries and what she’s comfortable with.. bc the first time they have sex she’s literally bent over a desk while at work. it kind of felt discomforting in a light of her previous harassment. there was also no personal development from rosie. rather than exploring her journey of healing, growth, or empowerment, the narrative seems to move on quickly, focusing more on her new relationship with ford. — this is a billionaire romance but he does absolutely nothing to showcase that he is a BILLIONAIRE.. no wait he attends one gala at the end and throws 100k at rosie like it was pocket change #goals 😍 im still confused on what his job actually was bc he barely even works and rosie just writes out spreadsheets for him once she is hired by him. what here screams “billionaire.” will i be reading the next book? of course, this being a complete miss for me won’t stop me from continuing on this series and wests’ character seems so fun. and he is an ACTUAL single dad so i can’t wait to read his book next!! i feel like i need to go and continue on with the chestnut springs series bc from the things i’ve heard i feel like i will enjoy that series sm more. thank you to bloom books for the arc───♡─────────────well this was a huge disappointment!! 😭 rtc —aaa i just got approved for the arc!! 🤭💓",2

Yay me 🥲😭 ✔️ Small town romance✔️ Single dad✔️ Brother's best friend✔️ He falls firstI'll keep it short and simple cause I can't with this book.  It's so bland, there is no life to it!  Just meaningless words on paper imo. It has no actual plot as it's  a character driven story  but there is no character development, especially for the fmc. I found  Rosie  to be annoying. Like why does she have to pick unnecessary arguments just cause she's quirky? I was over her personality in a few pages.  Ford  is nice but that's about it. He's just nice and nothing else. Tho I did like his relationship with his daughter and how he worked on it. The banter between Rosie and Ford makes no sense to me. It feels so forced and written for the sake of it.  The chemistry between these two is non-existent.  I don't even wanna start on the spice. 🤢 I skimmed a fair bit in the last 100 pages cause I was dying of boredom. Sure there are some sweet moments but not enough to save the book.

I don't get the hype around him and their chemistry was bleckh (brothers best friend is such a good trope) it was done so wrong here and childhood friends to lovers 😂 whoever invented that trope would be smothering Elsie in her sleep because how can you manage to ruin a trope that bad?

   ❛ I first kissed her and found her sleeping here. just like I dreamed of before I even realized she was the dream. ❜ 
upon its very first chapter, 'Wild Love' embarked me through a tumult of emotions; deprived of any tears; cheeks sore from smiling; heart aching. to characterize it succinctly, it was utterly beautiful. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that Elsie Silver has an affinity and affection for the found family arc. i found that it was brilliantly harmonized in this book with the atypical path that molded the single-dad-trope and the plot-line. it was both invigorating and agreeable to read. 
  ”he looks at her like she terrifies him. and she looks at him with stars in her eyes. but they’re both too alike to say a single word to each other. It’s adorable.
we accompanied the characters through the bizarre dynamics they had to embrace, which was sincerly one of the utmost aspects of the narrative. passing by their peaks and valleys, it was realistically sculpted deriving out of heartfelt moments to the embarrassing, joyful and hilarious ones. should i drop an unpopular opinion..? i love kids in romances. especially the funny ones. Cora won my heart. without a doubt, she was the brightest part of the book. she enhanced it in numerous ways. her non-conventional twelve-year-old persona is just one example. the bond she forged with Rosie, the female main character, and the blossoming father-daughter relationship she shared with Ford, the male protagonist, are another ones.
  ”because as much as I don’t need a knight in shining armor to defend my honor, I’m relieved I have one who feels compelled to do so.”
Rosie had to overcome many obstacles before she could wave the white flag and return home. I loved how unapologetically imperfect she was drawn and how, throughout the chapters and lines, she imbibed herself with it and accepted it. she was a hell of a woman with an acute sense of humor and a fierce sense of loyalty. Ford, alias the World’s Hottest Billionaire, emphasized irresistibly the nerd demeanor. i loved seeing him grow in Cora’s vicinity and how he tiptoed around the impromptu dad-role he has to disguise into. 
  “the more things change, the more they stay the same.”
the romance was distilled through years and decades of longing and unspoken love. i loved how the storytelling didn’t shadow that part and translated it along the lines of memories and diary’s maculatedbpages. it grasped so crudely and beautifully their anterior bond. but it also paralleled with their adulthood relationship. how Ford was still obsessed with Rosie. how she had to relay on him the same way she used to. unfortunately, both of them have now dethroned any other Elsie Silver couple for me. p.s. :some side characters layered the book with beautiful colors and i cannot wait to meet them in their own dedicated romances. i even reconnected with dear characters from the prior series and it was absolutely precious to read!many thanks to the author and Periwinkle Pony PR for providing the arc in exchange for an honest review——-what am i supposed to do with my life now 🧍🏽‍♀️? rtc—I GOT THE ARC. bye .",5
"186","199368721","The author's writing is in a class of its own. It was fresh and engaging, perfectly capturing youth's charm, excitement, and uncertainties. The main characters' chemistry coupled with the setting of a small town, Rose Hill, came to life so vividly. It had me rooting for them from the beginning. Listening to it was so much fun and a total escape into a world of romantic adventures! Something I have yearned for since forever. Audiobook version: ""Wild Love""The book is its characters specially, the protagonist Rosie. Her confusion, discovery of herself and her first blush of love felt so real and relatable. The theme was etched beautifully with friends who brought depth and humor to the story. And the town, my heart captured it so completely then. The romance, too, was spot on. An absolute sweet and sassy romance filled in the right doses with sweet moments and some deep heartening conversations. And the author surely knows how to make words play magic and build tension. I was listening to the book with bated breaths, wondering if they would work out. As a start to the series, Wild Love worked just great, only growing my curiosity to visit Rose Hill again and again and hoping that everyone finds what they were looking for!",5

"188","199368721","2.75 stars I love Elsie’s books. I love single dads stories. I love small town romances. I love pinning for years. So I don’t really know where it went wrong.This was one of my anticipated releases for this year. I was so sure it’s gonna be a hit, but it ended up being kind of disappointment. My main issue is that the characters truly lacked chemistry. This might be a subjective opinion or whatever, but I just couldn’t see anything between them. No spark, no chemistry, no nothing. They didn’t make sense together despite the fact that he has been pinning after her for years. There wasn’t much going on in the book. No actual plot, it all felt kinda forced. The plot just didn’t flow smoothly like all her other books if that makes sense. And don’t get me started on the forced third act conflict, it was so meh and eye-rolling worthy. This wasn’t a bad book nor a good one, just so meh and kinda boring and dull. It didn’t really make me feel anything. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~pre-reading:Elsie’s dads are superior.

★ 2.75 stars rounded upI fear my hopes were too high...it just didn't hit the mark for me. I love the single dad trope and Heartless is one of my favourite Elsie books so far so I was expecting this to go differently. I understand that she wanted to do a different spin on the trope so it wasn't a carbon copy of Heartless but this is the opposite end of the spectrum...I can't say too much about this book without spoiling but in short, I didn't love the way Ford became a father and tbh, I didn't even feel like he actually was one in this book. His daughter, Cora was sweet but she felt like more of an afterthought to the story than a heavy focus. The circumstances around her conception and her mother were so insane to me and I never got past that as much as I tried. I actually think Rosie had a better connection with Cora than Ford did because hardly any time was dedicated to Ford and Cora.— I appreciated Rosie's struggle to be successful woman in a business run by men but I would have loved to see her experience with her prior employer spoken about more. It was important and it was skimmed over? And then imagine my surprise when she gets in a relationship with her boss and they didn't speak about her trauma? This was a missed opportunity and went against the point this storyline was trying to make. I understand Rosie wanting to take back her power and making decisions for herself but it just felt surface level to me. This is where my appreciation ended for her, I didn't like how she was stringing along her boyfriend and making him come see her to do what she should have done months ago. — Ford was hot but I didn't respect him because of his actions and the way he spoke to a literal child?? Also, sorry it's so hard being a billionaire?! It must be so exhausting having money to donate and being around people who are successful? I think Ford forgets he has the ability to be philanthropic because of his company and his nepotism. He didn't offer a whole lot to the story in comparison to some of Elsie's other MMC's.— Ford and Rosie did have some cute moments but I was mostly bored. It took me over a week to read this because I had no desire to pick it up. The chemistry was missing and the angst? Idk where that went. For people that have pinning after each other since they were younger I just didn't buy it? This book would have strongly benefited from dual timelines because otherwise you're left filling in the gaps yourself and making assumptions that aren't unfavourable. I go into books like this looking for something cute and fluffy and don't expect much out of it and it's an added bonus if there's an emotional conflict. These characters just didn't offer me much at all and I'm not even going to talk about the third act conflict. My main highlight is when there was a surprise appearance from one of the characters in the Chestnut Springs series but it was brief. I'll definitely still continue with this series and I have faith in you Elsie, but this one was just not it for me. •───────•°•❀•°•───────•pre-review: It's officially cowboy season again 🤩🤠 I'm going into this with such HIGH hopes!!

"192","199368721","“I want messy and snarky and… I want a wild love. I want you.”Wild Love made me feel nostalgic for a place that only exists in fiction. Elsie never fails to charm me with her small town romances. She has a way with words, her creativity never fails to conjure up a beautiful and alluring small town in her stories that give the most comforting and serene vibes. I had my uncertainty related to Wild Love after seeing mixed reviews but honestly this surpassed my expectations. I was excited to explore to Rose Hill, new familial bonds and love stories, new characters that will become my comfort characters as this series goes on and Elsie did an amazing job with Wild Love, giving us a heartfelt, hilarious and lovely story to obsess over.“I broke every speed limit to get to you.”The story started with Ford finding out he has a twelve year old daughter in a very bizarre way. I loved how Elsie crafted out their relationship and how Ford and Cora developed this father-daughter love slowly and steadily. It was uncomfortable at times for them but they gave their best to each other, especially, Ford. I loved Cora and her bright and bitchy personality. She was amazing and one of the best part of this book. Ford was incredible with Cora given his circumstances and he did an absolute amazing job as a new daddy. The found family arc in Wild Love was beautifully and affectionately written and I love the way Ford, Cora and Rosie found a family of their own together.“He looks at her like she terrifies him. And she looks at him with stars in her eyes. But they’re both too alike to say a single word to each other. It’s adorable.”➸ Ford Grant, the World's grumpiest and hottest billionaire is actually a nerd in reality. He is ambitious, thoughful and has a thing for his bestfriend's sister for years. He was living in delutional phase thinking pretending to Rosie would stop him fall for her but he fell first and fell harder for her. Ford is different from Elsie's other male protagonists. He is soft-hearted but hides it all behind the untouchable façade he created for himself. I always wanted for him to have his own story and Elsie did not disappoint because Wild Love is exactly the book I imagined for Ford. Him being a daddy was cherry on top with his over-protective streak going for Cora. He was downright irresistible when he was in papa bear mode for his daughter. He's an absolute sweetheart and the things he did for Rosie, like wearing the key to her diary as a necklace for a decade because he wanted to be close to her? “I first kissed her and found her sleeping here. Just like I dreamed of before I even realized she was the dream.”➸ Rosalie Belmont had always been a people pleaser, always tried to be the good kid with her scholarly and bright personality. She's a sunshine girl with a fierce and protective nature. She never wanted people to feel burden on her behalf so became what they expected her to be but she lost herself in that process of becoming someone else. Rosie went through some rough times and she realised it's time to recreate herself from scratch again with grace and kindness, but this time she wanted to do it for her own good and in town where she grew up. Rosei is an imperfect character and at times she can be annoying with her antics but I found her funny and charming and I loved how she's been driving Ford wild to the point of insanity. Gotta keep your man on toes all the damn time.“You can take the girl out of the small town, but you can’t take the small town out of the girl.”: ̗̀➛ Ford & RosieChildhood frenemies turned boss and employee? Rosie and Ford pretended to hate each other for years because hating was easy for them than giving in to their temptations. Hating and exchanging verbal jabs is their kind of foreplay. They can never get enough of each other and I love how obsessed they were with other. Their romance was a concoction of seveal years of hate-love friendship, animosity, yearning and longing for each other and tantalising sexual tension and desire that was simmering between them for years. It was a beautiful transition from Ford and Rosie finally realising that they were always more than just frenemies to them confessing their love for each other. The diary segments gave an insight to Rosie's feelings for Ford and how she was smitten with yound Ford and his nerdy and introvert personality. They have been falling for each other for years and that unspoken love slowly translated itself into their adulthood when they saw each other again after a decade. I loved seeing them fall in love together and loved seeing them fall in love with new life. “Because who the hell else would put up with me?” Then he drops his head to my chest and murmurs, “Putting up with you is my favorite thing to do.”“She feels like heaven. She feels like home. She feels like she’s finally mine.”To say I am obsessed with this series would be an understatement. I was expecting the whole 'stay away from my sister' drama but West didn't so much as punch Ford after knowing about their relationship. He was secretly shipping Ford and Rosie together for years and I just love him for that. I am already so far gone for West and I just can't wait to see him in Wild Eyes. I have a feeling he's going to be my favourite because cinnamon hero and single dad is my new kryptonite.—————need a good single dad to cure my slump sickness 😋 and in elsie silver we believe 🙏🏼—————- single dad- brother's best friend- frenemies to lovers vibes- he falls firstThis book has all the major tropes and THE ICONIC SINGLE DAD TROPE BY ELSIE??

"197","199368721","3 Stars ★“I want messy and snarky and…I want a wild love.""Honestly, I had put this one off due to all of the mixed reviews. I finally picked it up, knowing that Elsie could pull me out of my slump. Though I enjoyed it, and this did just that, I did have some issues with it.Wild Love is the first book in the Rose Hill series. It is a small town, brother's, best friend, single dad, workplace romance. You will find some humorous moments, pining, banter, tension, and he falls first. With all of these things that I love, it just wasn't the case here. I have so many different feelings about this. Were there things that I loved? Yes, but there were also things that stopped me from enjoying it fully. Ford has moved to Rose Hill, where he spent summers as a teenager to get his recording studio off the ground and escape the fame of being announced for Forbes' hottest billionaire. It comes to a halt when a young girl shows up claiming that she is his daughter. While he's trying to balance this new life of his business and parenting, his best friends sister comes barreling back into town. Insert Roaslie, the girl he's been pining over for years, and she's in need of a job after leaving the city. She offers to work for Ford as his assistant, and he hires her, not able to say no.Ford Grant was always the nerd that grew up to be a hot billionaire that is protective of the ones he cares for, especially for the one he's loved for years, his best friends sister. However, outside of that to me he didn't have much of a personality. I found him to be boring through most of this. It wasn't until towards the end that I started to like him, but even then, he did things that pissed me off. And the overthinking, I normally get because I myself am an overthinker, but he took it to the extreme. He can never make up his mind. The one thing that I can say that I loved about him is his relationship with his daughter Cora. They had they cutest and sweetest moments even though they were awkward together, which in turn had me giggling at times. ""I first kissed her and found her sleeping here. Just like I dreamed of before I even realized she was the dream.""Rosie Belmont was always the good one not getting into trouble, the one that has always been the people pleaser, achieving to make everyone around her proud but underneath all of this she is messy and chaotic. I loved seeing this side of her as well as the funny and snarky. I really did enjoy her. The relationship with her and Cora was so sweet as they were very similar in some instances and just bonded so well. The one thing that I didn't enjoy was that I wanted to see more growth and healing. She had to of had some trauma from being sexually assaulted by her ex boss. It was touched on in the beginning when it happened and towards the end, but I wanted more depth as it was very surface level.""The more things change, the more they stay the same""Ford and Rosie started off as frenemies with him pining for her for years, though she was always off limits being his best friends sister. They have always had this back and forth banter with one another pretending to hate each other. While I enjoyed this at first, especially in their email exchanges, it started to get old. He was so down bad for her that he had worn her diary key on a necklace for years. While she had diary entries that were thoughts of Ford. It shouldn't have taken all this time to muster up the courage to show their true feelings. I just wanted to shake them both and tell them to grow up. Most of my frustration was with Ford not being able to decide if he should pursue the girl he has always loved because he doesn't want to damage his friendship with his best friend. My thoughts, though, are you are the one person that he would trust wholeheartedly with his sister, and he will eventually get over any type of issue he has with it, if any. The other issue is I didn't feel much chemistry between them until about 90% after their ""breakup"" that was very much not needed. It felt like their playing this game of pretending to hate one another got in the way of that. I think without the tiptoeing of that line, I would have felt the romance between them more. ""She smells like the lilacs that grow down by the lake, and she feels like heaven. She feels like home. She feels like she’s finally mine.""There were some moments that I enjoyed so much. One of those seeing a glimpse of Willa here even if it was breif. I also enjoyed the epilogue, though it was somewhat predictable it was cute and different if that makes sense. While I didn't enjoy this fully, I will be contuning the series. I have faith that the next book will be the one for me as I was already eating up scenes with West.Favorite quotes and moments""He looks at her like she terrifies him. And she looks at him with stars in her eyes. But they’re both too alike to say a single word to each other.

Not even close. But I can fuck you like I do if that’s what you need.”“Hear this, Rosie. You are worth every penny. Every fortune. Every investment. Every risk.

  My Thoughts:
Ford Grant is TOO perfect. He is a super sexy, philanthropic billionaire with a heart of gold. His only 'flaw' is that he gives short answers so people occasionally think he's a dick. That’s it. At first, he came off as super hot but then we learn he’s been obsessively pining over the same woman for 15 years…It's supposed to be sweet but no man would ever, especially a man with his success. I guess that’s what makes him so “different” and “special” but it read so far fetched I could not even deal. Rosie Belmont was . . . uninspiring. I could not even tell you anything about her besides she’s from a small town, got out and had a career as a suit, had an inappropriate experience at work and got fired so she comes home. Oh, and she still has a boyfriend forever in the story who she wants to break up with but doesn’t because she wants to do it in person. She also ‘HATES’ Ford because he . . . Wait I’m sorry, why does she supposedly hate him again? There’s no real reason. She was just forcing this notion that she hated him 24/7 and it was annoying as hell. It’s truly just because growing up they were playfully snarky to each other. But he never did anything to her, and vice versa, that would deserve hate. But they both kept having inner dialogue where they are like “oh I hated him but maybe I don’t hate him so much anymore blah blah blah.” You idiots. You are both delulu if you think you ever hated each other. And the entire premise of this story is them figuring out they don’t hate one another, which they never really did, but they 100% think so, and it just felt so forced and unnatural.***SPOILERS Ahead***The entire side plot about Ford having a child (because he donated sperm) was odd and unbelievable to me. I don’t know why, and maybe it’s just me, but I found it incredibly weird that Ford and Rosie immediately take on a parental role with Cora and start to say things like “I couldn’t imagine my life without her” and thinking of her as Ford’s daughter. But to me, being a sperm donor legit means jack shit. All Cora has is a DNA connection to Ford. So he’s a total stranger and yet Cora goes and lives with him. Like legit imagine you have a child and you just let them live with a stranger? I mean, I guess it was either Ford or foster care but how the situation unfolded didn’t come across as realistic to me. And then once she’s living with Ford, he and Rosie assume the role of a parent and start seeing themselves as such, while also acknowledging they’re not. This situation was not something I could ever see really playing out well in real life, which I get this is fiction but it just doesn’t seem feasible. What plot? It was all romance. The biggest issues were Ford and Rosie finally coming together, figuring out life with Cora, and that’s it? I thought maybe Ford would get his recording studio up and running and we’d see him manage the business and there’d be drama there but nah. I guess Rosie did have some added drama with her old work but that was only in the beginning and end.Overall, this book felt contrived with a too perfect MMC, irritating FMC, and forgettable and forced conflicts. This book took me days to read and by 75% I started skimming because I just could not get myself to care about all the office sex they were finally having. I only finished because it was my book club's book of the month. Side note, the majority of my book club had the same issues and gave this 3-stars or below.

"205","199368721",": ̗̀➛3.5 stars“If I could build you a boyfriend like a Build-A-Bear, he would come out as Ford Grant.”The grumpy man and sunshine girl dynamic is always a win, and Rosie and Ford pull it off perfectly. The way she teases him at work, gets him all flustered, and brings out his jealous side is a fun read. Rosie definitely has Ford wrapped around her finger, and his protectiveness over her and his daughter, Cora, made my heart melt. Ford’s humble and down-to-earth nature added so much depth to his character, but despite all that, I didn’t really feel like his role as a father landed for me. Cora was sweet but felt more like a background character, and I never fully connected with how Ford became a dad—it just didn’t sit right. I actually felt Rosie had a stronger connection with Cora than Ford did, which left me wanting more from their relationship.As for Rosie and Ford’s romance, while the banter and tension were fun, there wasn’t much else going on beneath the surface. It felt like their chemistry was trying too hard, especially since Ford supposedly loved her for 15+ years but hadn’t seen her in almost a decade? It didn’t feel believable to me, and their connection seemed more based on constant arguments than real substance.That said, Elsie Silver’s writing is always enjoyable, and I’ll still read anything she puts out. This book had its moments, but it didn’t quite reach the same heights as the Chestnut Springs series. I’m torn between 3.75 and 4 stars—there’s room for improvement, but I’m excited to see where this new series goes!“Hear this, Rosie. You are worth every penny. Every fortune. Every investment. Every risk. You are priceless to me.”",4
"206","194802722","4.75!“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don't get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.Those are the moments that make a life.Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.The things that matter.The things I can't stop longing for.”
Now I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily's best work and after a rant with Roxy I understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry's works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing is engaging and has you fully immersed in the book you probably won't see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn't make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there' just something so beautiful about it.Okay so it's basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fiancées cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There's this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at:
  ""Wait!' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. ""So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn't come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?''Im sorry,' I say again.'That fucking rules,' He says. 'How'd he take it?""
Daphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry's men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bug Roxy off so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was where He panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too late I won't elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)Their banter that I loved:
  ""True,' he says 'but I haven't had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed''Oh, they're all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV''Not us,' he says'No, we're adventurous' I say""_""I turn to look at him. 'Even when you try to be mean, you're nice,'His eyes seem to spark when he smiles. 'I'll try harder.""_""Do me a favor,' he says lightly, 'Unlock your door.''Why?''So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,' he says,'You would never,' I say'I would never' he admits.""_“Drink. Dance. Have fun.”“In a room with our exes,” I point out. “Who think we’re dating.”Miles’s smile hitches up. “See?” he says. “Doesn’t that sound fun?” 
I absolutely loved the friendship that Ashleigh and Daphne had because it was so down to earth and real and raw that I just fell in love with it and I think it was because Emily focused on Ashleighs character as well and gave her a story which made us understand where she was coming from and what was happening and how that eventually led them to be friends and I also loved how she supported Daphne's decisions but wont lie to her as well and would subtly try to make her understand things, she was certainly better than whatever the fuck Sadie was. Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.
  ""You're worth it, Daphne,"" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.'Miles?' I whisper. 'I do, I do what all those parts of you'His eyes open, molten, warm, 'Good,' He says. 'They want you too.'Then he kisses me.""
The romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn't like ' oh one look and im hard' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.Now,The things that could have been better; (spoilers)(credits;roxy)1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.3, Male povs because having Miles's POV would have been so interesting since would've gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.4, More drama by Miles's mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages more Now the scenes that I loved1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh5, Miles going to confront Daphne's dad6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.Overall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.

"207","194802722","2.5/5The review contains spoilers!What a forgettable, bland, boring and not Funny Story. This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I'm still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship — ""You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time — which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn't end up to be a fun read for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn't even close to the bond I had with January, who I'm starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quite okay"" about her if she hadn't moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn't that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn't so sure about it and who, speaking of which — let's get to him now. Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones's Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him
  
    ""Miles looks up at me. “They,” I say, “suck.” “She’s the love of my life,” he says. “The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.""
  
The love of your life? Hell no. I didn't like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn't happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne's answer was this
  
    ""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back? “Definitely not,” I say aloud.""
  
and Miles’s that
  
    ""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”
  
She cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don’t know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him. 
  
    ""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried. I still care about her.” 
  
She cheated on you and then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??
  
    ""I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.""
  
And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don't even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry's book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I'm in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily's book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card. ────────Me at my graduation: 😐Me at my wedding: 😐Me when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰",2
"208","194802722","I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.This book isn't my favorite among Emily Henry's works. ""Happy Place"" holds that position, while ""People We Meet on Vacation"" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry’s books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I'm sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I’m one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)But let's be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He’s caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous – not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I'm usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!I have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I've never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.I won't give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fiancée’s new fiancée’s ex-boyfriend couldn’t be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That’s why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don’t whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other’s rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.The plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fiancée Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra’s dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter’s door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?Yes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children’s librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fiancée defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter’s wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.But what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?Well, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on!

"209","194802722","my heart is broken. i feel like i'm dying. the world holds nothing for me anymore.i'm three starring this book.i adore emily henry, and i have since her magical realism days. i'd happily read her to-do lists if she released them once a year, and i'm sure even those would have more banter and loveliness and whimsy than your average full-length release just by virtue of being written by her. i'd say the same about her grocery lists, but i already do read those. (the woman writes a mean substack.)there were a few things i didn't love about this book. it tries to fit so much into a few hundred pages: our protagonist, daphne, is left by her fiance weeks before her wedding, causing her to: move in with miles, her fiance's new girlfriend's ex-boyfriend; realize she has no friends; begin a quest to find herself; get over the fiancé and fall in love with miles; join a variety of community groups and neighborhood activities; make her current job her dream job; repress some CLEAR mommy issues i thought we were going to address, and fully get over her daddy issues. all of this is happening so much.it comes at a cost, which is that typical emily henry magic (and i don't just mean the bygone magical realism i mourn every day and never shut up about). this book is not quite as funny — jokes feel forced, sometimes to the point that you can only identify something as reaching for funny because the character ""joked"" or ""played along"" instead of ""said."" it is not quite as polished, with writing feeling a bit unconfident, full of words italicized for emphasis and, you know, the whole verbs that aren't said thing. (there are a LOT of dialogue attribution words that aren't ""said."")and the characters have none of their usual better-version-of-reality charm. miles' nick miller archetype would never work for me personally, but my real issue with him is that his character traits fade once we're supposed to see him as a romantic prospect. our side characters, ashleigh and julia, feel like interchangeable joke-bots to the point of being vaguely threatening. (when they pop up on page in tandem i feel a sense of unease.)and to be honest, daphne has no self awareness. because there's so much happening in this book, everything has to be incredibly simple: daphne's issue with her dad, AND daphne's issue with miles, AND daphne's friends' issue with daphne all has to be the same. it makes for some moments of ridiculousness — like how can daphne be melting down about being wronged on the same city block where she realized several hours earlier she had wronged someone in that exact same way? how could she be so unwilling to give the grace she expects for herself? and how could emily henry set scenes of this book on a cherry farm in michigan when she knew what it would do to me, specifically?!sorry. that's the last time i'll bring up magical realism. i think.ol' daph just has too much to figure out about herself. i think this abandonment would be so completely traumatic even if she HADN'T built her entire life around her fiancé only to be left entirely alone, and even if it WASN'T eerily similar to her daddy issues, and even if she DIDN'T have a bunch of unresolved things going on up in ye olde memory palace, that the last thing she'd be doing is sticking around someone else's hometown flirting with her new roomie. especially since what she ends up doing is repeating the exact same cycle with no awareness at all.and in the worst offense, miles' illiterate texting style reminded me of the himbos i used to date (date doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in my wayward youth. which should be a jailable offense in and of itself.bottom line: like anything emily henry has ever written, this is better than a lot of books. it just isn't better than most emily henry ones.----------------------currently-reading updateme arriving to the world's biggest emily henry fan contest but my competition is all of goodreads(GUYS IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING)thanks to the publisher for the e-arc----------------------tbr reviewi would like to request that no one talk to me about anything that isn't this for the next 3 to 5 business years.",3
"210","194802722","to preface this review, i love and adore emily henry's books. book lovers is in my top 5 books of all time (and i am not a romance reader), and happy place is the only book that made me cry last year. time is truly measured in emily henry releases for me.my current emily henry rom com ranking is: book lovers (5 stars), happy place (5 stars), beach read (4.5 stars), funny story (3 stars), and people we meet on vacation (2.5 stars). if we have completely different rankings, you'll probably feel differently about this book!if you are a big romance reader (reading books for the romance), you will most likely enjoy this a lot. but if you are a lit fic reader who loves emily henry books for the protagonists and their introspection and the fact that her romance feels grounded and realistic (me), this might be a slight miss. it's been a while since i've described an emily henry book as just ""good"", but this one feels like that for me.funny story still has emily henry's signature witty dialogue and chemistry between miles and daphne. it is arguably her most commercial romance to date, filled with more romantic scenes between the two characters. daphne, after being dumped by her fiancé for his best friend, decides to room with miles, who was dumped by said best friend. in classic emily henry rom com style, funny story is set in a beautiful town in the midwest (michigan), charged with quick banter and heart to hearts between the characters. in this vein, the book felt like a mix of beach read and book lovers, in a sense.but not really. while it's impossible for me to dislike a emily henry book because of her writing, much of my enjoyment as a reader comes from being able to see myself and parts of my personality reflected through either protagonist. for book lovers, it was overwhelmingly nora, for happy place, it was harriet, for beach read, it was gus, and for people we meet on vacation, it was alex. and so on.the main qualm i had with funny story is that neither miles nor daphne felt relatable to me, which made it a less enjoyable read than her other books. this is why i say that my neutral stance on this book is most likely a personal one. daphne and miles both felt very confusing to me as characters, almost as if they were hybrids of emily henry's previous characters. i couldn't quite get either of their characterizations or defining traits. there is not a single emily henry book i didn't read in one sitting...until this one.like i mentioned above, a big reason for my love for emily henry books is her protagonists and how their introspection does not read like other commercial romance books, but more like literary fiction. her characters are well thought through, reflective, and very three dimensional. nora was literally just me from start to finish (so i don't have to really put forth a defense about three dimensionality). harriet's introspection on loneliness and living for other people genuinely changed my life. but daphne didn't really have any.the chemistry and get-together also felt a bit rushed and forced at times, and the dialogue and heart to hearts felt less genuine and blander than her other books. for a book called funny story, it was...not. i think my big issue was just with miles as well. he just didn't enough charisma and charm for this book to be memorable for me. wyn and alex didn't really either, but i related a lot to alex and wyn was redeemed through harriet. funny story is a great read and definitely still a cut above other romance books. but this one just didn't do it for me. i really hope her next release works for me!thank you berkley for the arc!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻i didn't love this i'm sorry guysreview to come⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻I GOT THE ARC WHOOOOOOO⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻emily henry ! do you want my firstborn? my college diploma? my kidney? you name it, it’s yours !!!",3
"211","194802722","Can a book survive on nothing but banter? Well, Funny Story sure tries.Okay, all you rabid Emily Henry fans. Before you chuck your rotten eggs at me, please let me explain.If ever there was an Emily Henry book that I should connect with, it's this one. Daphne is a librarian (my dream job) and she's in a pretend relationship with her roommate, Miles, in order to get back at her ex-fiancé (an intriguing premise). And yet, something was missing. I kept waiting for the story to grab me, and it never really did.I hate to say it, but the crux of the problem is that the whole thing was rather forgettable. I only just finished the book, and already I hardly remember anything about it. The characters, the interactions, even the conflicts, while all feelgood on the surface, were in fact fairly bland underneath. I enjoy a low-stakes beach read as much as the next gal, but there is a difference between low stakes and no stakes, and this was too much in the latter. At no point was there anything really on the line. The story just shambled along, with lots of banter and some minor conflicts here and there, until the requisite 300-some pages were met, and then it was called a book. Speaking of the conflicts, I totally didn't understand Daphne and Miles' issues, or even Daphne and Ashleigh's. Do people really get so upset and potentially break up relationships and friendships over such small issues? And each one, blown up to be so important, can only be resolved after much back and forth, with pages upon pages of dialogue of each person's feelings and the associated parental trauma that was at the root of all their misgivings. It was a bit much.Don't get me wrong, I did have fun. There were entertaining moments, and the banter was truly top notch. And it wasn't just for the main couple during romantic moments. No, the banter was interspersed everywhere and among everyone, so we got plenty of chuckle-worthy moments.But you can't just sustain a story on banter alone, no matter how delightful it is. When the characters feel as lackluster as Daphne and Miles and their conflicts equally bland and forced, it was hard to care either way if they ended up together, which is always a bad sign in a romance.I feel like I'm the only person out there who doesn't get heart-eyes at the merest mention of an Emily Henry book. My experiences so far have been largely underwhelming, or maybe I just haven't read the right books by her. Either way, I'll add this to the pile of Emily Henry books I've pretty much forgotten the moment I finished.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Beach ReadPeople We Meet on Vacation~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3
"212","194802722","funny story? ha. ain’t nothing funny about the way my heart was tugged while reading this book. emily henry im under your bed cuz why’d you write a fmc that has the same thoughts and fears as me?!? 💀opposites attract has never been written better than before this. Daphne and Miles were written for each other like a prophecy. this is one of emily’s most horniest books yet, and i was there for it all the way through. “his mouth is still cool from the lemonade, his breath tinged with hints of lavender, and his hand slides around to the small of my back, fisting into my shirt…” i love these descriptions. there was something very tender when he said “always so buttoned up” to Daphne, who’s a librarian, as he was ripping her clothes off. 🫶🏽i just know if i had an attentive, calm, loving, cherishing, beautiful man like Miles in my life he’d be extremely manly to the point where i can turn off my brain, be a girly girl, and not have a worry in the world. his gentle love felt like a caress to my soul. the way he effortlessly took care of her, saw the signs, respected her space and mind. Miles…YOU GOT IT LIKE THAT?!? he makes me feel like im standing in sunlight☀️ lives were changed when Miles said, “ I know I’m not who you pictured yourself with, but I think I could be, eventually. If you’ll let me. So don’t go. Because I don’t want you to. Because you’re my best friend, and I’m in love with you.” brother my knees just hit the floor in the middle of walmart😭Daphne such a well rounded character. her fears were so real and the way she overcame them was nothing if not humbling. emily writes her fmc so nuanced and layered and deep. i feel like she’s writing about me and im ok with that 😁also if i ever catch Peter in public im throwing a brick at himemily henry books ranking:1) beach read2) funny story3) book lovers 4) people we meet on vacation 5) happy place",5

"219","194802722","4 stars!i have now read three emily henry books, and while she is undoubtedly a talented writer, what i find most fascinating is the loyalty of her readers; going to your nearest bookstore on release day for a book that is probably no less than $30 — that’s dedication. and you know what, i think i finally get it.i didn’t have particularly high expectations for funny story, but in all transparency, this just might be my favorite book of hers, hovering right above beach read (which i thoroughly enjoyed) and book lovers (of which i have no recollection but still think highly). it’s far from perfect, but it does a lot of things well, and that’s quite a feat considering it’s less than 400 pages (proof that less is more!) and, according to the reviews i’ve seen, her most “romantic” romance novel yet.still — i think funny story, like her other books, straddles the line between lighthearted romcom and introspective women’s fiction. the banter in this one is some of the best she’s written — it’s reread worthy, the kind that makes you laugh out loud. the characters themselves are wonderfully written; it’s obvious that emily henry adores them. she crafted miles and daphne with so much care and thought, adding dimension to the characters through their experiences and focusing on how said experiences changed and ultimately shaped them into the miles and daphne we read about in this book. it’s rare for me to like one mc in a romance book, let alone both, but daphne felt so relatable — her thoughts mirrored my very own at times. and miles i had a soft spot for because how could you not? he’s this is me trying personified. and the romance? god, the romance. i’m a harsh rater, even more so when it comes to contemporary romance. but in every! one! of! her! books! emily henry prioritizes the emotional connection between the two main characters. and the way she develops their relationship and has them slowly open up to each other? it gets me. every. time. i live for their vulnerable moments, for their conversations about their pasts, about what haunts them, as much as i live for their banter.despite this being first and foremost a romance, it is also a story about rediscovering yourself, relearning who you are and what you like and what you want out of life. it’s a reminder to live for yourself, to spend your days with the people you love, to love them without restraint or inhibition. the ending is beautifully uplifting, the last sentence tying back to the very first, the tone hopeful and reassuring. it’s what i think i needed right now as someone who’s entering her twenties and is so intimidated by the unknown, who’s tempted to run away from the unpredictability of it all. and i’m sure it’s a book i’ll come back to when, in five years, my life will probably make even less sense than it does now. thank you to netgalley and berkley publishing for the arc 💓",4
"220","194802722","i'm all for recycling but does she have to keep writing the same book every yearboring. repetitive. bland characters. a mc that moans every time she eats something (is this some kind of weird new sex thing. was i supposed to be turned on. sparks were definitely flying but that's just because i considered setting myself and the book on fire multiple times). i was actually gonna give this two stars but the more i think about it the more i hate it. also i'm in a very bad mood. lol.i have said it with book lovers before and i will say it again: all her books feel the same. wake me up in two days time and yell the names alex, gus, and miles at me and i will struggle assigning them to the right books. i don't even remember happy places mmc... and i actually liked that book... meh whatever.those two had about the same amount of chemistry as me and that work project i have been putting off for weeks because it bores me to death just thinking about. watching paint dry would have been more exciting than reading this. maybe it isn't too late yet. someone get me a brush. my theory concerning emily henry's popularity on goodreads is that she always writes about female characters that in one shape or another love books. and... that's basically most of the demographic here so. which is fine and yay yippiee juhu, representation (the poor underrepresented class of *checks notes* white cishet female readers) but like .... please write a book that isn't just the previous ones rearranged and glued together? also, the story wasn't even funny???",1

  [Photo: Waning Bay Public Library Inaugural Overnight Read-A-Thon]‘If I had to be marooned, I’m glad it was with you.’Bust out the tweed and toast your awkward roommate if you’ve got one, Emily Henry has a romcom for you. Sometimes, just when it feels like smooth sailing on the raft you call a life, an unexpected fucker of a wave smashes your plans to splinters and send you off course and adrift. Such is the case for Daphne in Emily Henry’s charming new novel, Funny Story, whose life has been shipwrecked upon the shores of a Lake Michigan vacation town with the ex of her ex’s new fiance. You read that right, and these mutual exes are such a smart match they are practically named after each other, Peter and Petra, so out with the tweed and in with the twee I suppose. But, as Daphne learns, sometimes a shipwreck can be a new start to something more beautiful. One of this books biggest strengths in allowing the narrative to wade through sorrows to create a portrait of adults discovering how to carry their own baggage and how their interactions with others are affected by it with a lot of the drama not being a miscommunication trope, per say, but more people tripping themselves up into confirmation bias based on their own personal traumas. It has some grit that grounds the otherwise breezy narrative and the real love story is learning to love oneself in order to love and be loved. It does wrap up a bit overly idyllic but honestly, I felt the biggest cracks in the veneer of the story was when it tried to make things happier than it probably needed to be but I understand why that is the case. With her signature witty banter, wry humor, and characters that are easy to fall in love with as they fall apart and into love themselves, Funny Story is a endearing tale about picking up the pieces only to discover oneself amidst the wreckage, learn to be yourself for yourself, and find a love where you least expect. ‘The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.’Alright let’s talk about love and stuff (surprise: the “stuff” is trauma!) I found Funny Story to read as a much quieter novel than most of Emily Henry’s works, but also found that, coupled with a slow-burn plot that lets scenes and character introspection really breathe, to be part of what made it so endearing for me. This will probably take some criticism for being slow but my favorite books are the sort that don’t exactly have what most people call a “plot” soooo this was fine for me. Funny Story reads more along the lines of the coziness in Book Lovers while also being more successful than I found Happy Place to be. Having just read Lynn Painter’s Happily Never After, I felt like this was a successful version of the many things that story tried to be (both books, however, have a thing about eating pizza being sexy which…ok…???) where the characters actually felt their age, the fake dating felt plausible, the third act drama was passably believable for the genre. It does try to tie up too many loose ends and solve all the issues and I don't think we needed that, but I suppose cliches are cliche for a reason and there are expectations in genres so thats more a Me thing. And like, sure there's a lot to pick at but also it’s aiming to be a fun book and it lands that aspect while also managing to have a dynamic look at how past hurts can haunt our self-esteem and hinder our vulnerability when trying to connect with others and that helped hold the story together. One person's breakdown is another person’s novel glue I guess? Wait, I think I just finally understood literature.‘You can't force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don't.’This is a fairly character driven narrative of self-discovery and trauma processing that just so happens to stumble into romance so having the characters be in their early 30s helped bring this to life. Also that everything sucks and they just keep having to go to work and smile because they work public facing jobs–I FELT THAT SO HARD. I’ve found in similar novels that the characters felt far too young for their ages whereas Funny Story captures being an adult but not having the stable career/family/housing/etc that would make one “feel adult.” It's a very Millennial narrative where jokes like ‘are we evil or just immature?’ to laugh off behavior felt very true to life and all these characters seemed to walk onto the page directly out of the sort of single, early 30s service industry folks I’ve known and been friends with. But it also positions the characters in the wreckage of their Round 1 attempt at adulthood where they can no longer pretend they aren’t a product of their past and have to weigh out how their past traumas and coping mechanisms have embedded into their personalities. Especially since both Miles and Daphne are still reeling from hurts caused by the actions of their parents and don’t have a healthy relationship to serve as a compass for their own (and Daphne’s father is still a source of constant disappointment). ‘I don’t want you to look at me like I’m broken,’ Miles says at one point and this cuts to the heart of how these character’s present themselves: eager to show they are alright while feeling far from fine inside and wanting to hide that.’It’s easy to be loved by the ones who’ve never seen you fuck up. The ones you’ve never had to apologize to, and who still think all your ‘quirks’ are charming.’Since so much of dating involves understanding each other’s defense mechanisms and unpacking how past traumas inform your interpersonal relationships, being able to be vulnerable is important to intimacy and Funny Story does well by showing how frustrating it can be to open yourself up at the same emotional places where you are currently bruised. Though, speaking of intimacy, readers should know Emily Henry is not a closed-door romance writer (as Ashleigh says it is ‘definitely not PG’) and while the sex scenes are fairly awkward here (I suspect the term “cringe” will get used in a lot of reviews) I think thats part of their charm as these are just…awkward people. Henry wrote a rather humorous article (read it HERE) on how to write sex scenes and the key detail she returns to several times is vulnerability and embracing the awkward, but also using the scenes to progress the characters. ‘The scene has to change things. Because every scene has to change things.And that’s it. As close as I think I could get teaching someone to write (or rewrite) a sex scene. You have to treat it like any other scene, because that’s what it is…It has to move the story. It has to shift the emotional landscape. It doesn’t have to be universally deemed sexy (it can’t; people like different things) and it doesn’t have to avoid the territory of cringe (it won’t, for the aforementioned reason). It simply has to be true to the story.’While I’m not sure the scenes here really count as plot progression, I found the awkwardness that leaves the characters rather flustered and confused about their relationship to work as part of the character study that seems to be the focus of this book. Its a novel about finding yourself but thankfully its not white folks “finding themselves” by going to India or Joshua Tree listening to The Doors, its just getting high and watching action movies with your roommate and getting some “accidental” action of your own.‘She’s a walking fantasy and I’m a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.’Learning to love oneself in all your faults and failures is difficult, but the joy in the discovery of what makes you “you” comes alive through Daphne quite well. The set up is pretty great and Henry launches you into it rather quickly. I do enjoy how it sort of mimics the set up in Book Lovers where she gets dumped in a very romcom ending “I realized my best friend was my love all along” way like Daphne is the discard fiance that barely gets any lines and seems lame anyways (so I guess shoutout to anyone who maybe identified with Mark Ruffalo’s fiance in 13 Going On 30?). This is just another incident in a long line of feeling not important in the lives of those who claim to love you, and having had an absentee father taught her a few self-defense mechanisms long ago: ‘Trust people’s actions, not their words.Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back.Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you.Don’t wait on people who don’t jury for you.’Being free from a relationship she thought would sail her happily from life has also made her reflect on how she never really formed a solid sense of self and instead allowed a relationship to fill in all the blanks for her. ‘I always cleaved to people I love and tried to orient my orbit around them,’ she realizes, which was an attempt to ‘make myself unleavable.’ And guess what? They all left. But now she has a new opportunity to find herself in it all. ‘Im not sure which parts of me are him and which parts are genuinely my own and I want to know. I want to know myself, to test my edges and see where I stop and the rest of the world begins.’Having also ended up in a Michigan lakeshore vacation town only for my supposedly “got it together” lifeplans to go down like the Edmund Fitzgerald (if you are from Michigan you are required to love the Edmund Fitzgerald and think of the Great Lakes like some fierce god that gives life but takes it away. Any museum is like “Science/Art/History/etc is so cool!” Michigan museums are like “the Lake is a cruel mistress who will kill you and everyone you love!”), this all resonated with me. Too much maybe. But I loved seeing her come to love it and find her own place. ‘I feel embarrassing pride at having become a regular at someplace new all on my own,’ she thinks about becoming a familiar face in a coffee shop. Can confirm that is a cool feeling when you feel utterly alone in the world. Good for you, Daphne, find your place.‘There’s no place on this earth like Waning Bay.’Speaking of place, Emily Henry excels at capturing a sense of place and embedding it into her narratives as if the local community itself were a supporting cast character in her romcoms. It helps, too, that her locales tend to offer plenty of comedic relief along with their atmosphere. Henry has spoken at length about the importance of “place” in crafting her novels  in interviews, stating that ‘I want my characters to feel like they grew up in the place where [my books are] set.’ In Funny Story, however, we watch Daphne as she has to learn a new place being stuck in a Northern Michigan vacation community, but it is less the way learning a place is about learning to better understand her love interest as it was in Book Lovers and more about learning to understand herself. Luckily she is aided by her new roommate, Miles, who also had to find his way amidst this community after shipwrecking there himself (can relate, buddy). Henry captures these Michigan communities in highly specific and humorous ways while making it still relatable to those unfamiliar with them. Maybe I’m biased and Daphne being a librarian and Miles being a bartender at a cherry themed wine bar is just something I’d enjoy because I work in a library after having myself been a wine bartender at a cherry themed establishment. But aspects of Michigan vacation towns felt so true to life. I laughed at the bar named “BARn” which is so eye-rollingly Michigan. But also aspects like seeing a young couple that are ‘on a first date which might somehow be an actual vacation,’ or everyone having their “corn guy, jam connection or cheesemonger, or someone saying things like being on the water is probably what church is to some folks. But for real, if you need amazing tomatoes, I know a guy.‘A good librarian makes all the difference.’The side characters are great as well, like the younger sister who brings in a lot of heartfelt discussions on family dynamics in response to family traumas, or the single-mom librarian. The library aspects are a bit kitschy but charming and I’m glad Henry presents the very real issues of how much blatant sexual harassment librarians face or the random moments of extreme anger or weirdness and how we just…deal with it and move along like a blip in the day. I usually hate when authors add libraries or librarians into plots because it's so stereotypically twee or inaccurate but Henry pulls it off well. Back to the sister for a moment, I thought the age gap between siblings was explored in a pretty comically-true-to-life way and how it wasn’t miscommunication between them but just…lack of communicating at all because you just assume what the other person is thinking. Which, okay real. That plays into the third act drama as well where its less a miscommunication and more falling victim to your own confirmation bias and assumptions. But Miles is sweet. I really liked Miles, guys. Miles feels like people I've met, especially in my bartending days. Also a coworker told me they think Miles is based on me. He’s not, I don’t own crocs (shoutout to the cover artist for including that). Did he do something sort of uncool at the end that Daphne is understandably upset about? Yes. Not great. But also did it feel like...well, something you'd hear a friend tell you about why their mad at a guy? Absolutely. I also don't know if this actually needed a successful romance? Maybe that's just me but the aspect about loving yourself and existing outside the circle of your partner was pretty great and we could have left it at that.‘A second act I fell into, and the home that I chose, as much as it chose me.I can’t wait. I can’t wait for this whole world I’ve invited to surprise me.’All in all, Funny Story is a sweet story of summer, libraries and finding joy in a new town and new friend. What I really loved about this book—even when it made me cry because I sobbed at the end—is how it just felt like people interacting with people and stumbling through their own issues instead of having some driving plot pushing people in directions. What I’m getting at is they felt like people instead of chess pieces for the sake of plot. The third act drama is done well too. Though when Henry tries to tell you that Michiganders refer to vacationers as “fudgies” for coming here to get our fudge (which is yum)...no we don’t. But the people from the Upper Peninsula DO in fact call the lower Peninsula “trolls.” Nobody in this novel says “ope” though, which is the Michigan noise for everything. Daphne should have said “ope” during a sex scene, I would have fallen over and then made this novel the State flag or something. Anyways, I enjoyed this and I hope you will too.4/5‘Family. The real kind, who will always love you, even when your decisions make no sense to them.’",4

This was such a good story, I loved following it and it was genuinely just cute. Her writing was just smooth and buttery. I usually don't like the FMC in romances (but I've only really read Ali Hazelwood and all her characters are the same person in different fonts) - but she was really relatable and I was rooting for her the whole time. Her whole 'finding herself journey' was so wholesome and heartwarming to follow. I relate to her relationship with her mother, and with finding friends. I think I do the same thing too, but I just didn't know how to express it until Emily Henry put it into words. I rarely sink the time into people and just conclude they'll be an acquaintance. Miles is a top tier guy, I would totally date him in real life and he'd give me so many butterflies - I'd also think he was being 'just nice' like Daphne did and not that he actually liked me.I love Julia and Ashleigh as well - such girls girls, I would love to have friends like them.

"229","194802722","★ 2.75 starsi guess it’s time for me to start considering that maybe i’m not exactly the target audience for Emily Henry’s books. see, i don’t think she’s a bad author. i really don’t. believe it or not, i do think she’s a good writer and i can understand (to a certain extent) why most people are obsessed with her work. but as much as i tried and keep trying, i can’t be one of those people.aside from this book, i’ve read four other books by EH. you can easily guess which ones because they are her most popular: Beach Read, Book Lovers, People We Meet On Vacation and Happy Place. i hated Book Lovers & PWMOV, but enjoyed Beach Read and Happy Place [she’s very hit or miss as you can notice]. however, while these two books were enjoyable — back when i read them, at least — i can’t exactly say i was obsessed with them. were they good? well, yes, but they weren’t perfect and i personally found them a bit overhyped. my not-so-extraordinary experiences with her past works were the main reason why i didn’t have high expectations for Funny Story. although, deep down, i wanted it to be the book that would make me say “wow... now i really understand all the hype she gets, i’m definitely an Emily Henry fan now!” but that obviously did not happen.it’s such a shame because this book actually started off good. i mean... kind of. in the first 50% i was convinced that this was going to be a 3 star read — i know people have different thoughts about three star ratings; some think it’s reserved for bad reads, others think it’s reversed for decent/‘just okay’ reads. in my opinion, it can mean both, it just depends on the book. at first, i thought Funny Story would be getting the “decent/‘just okay’ three star rating” from me. i was liking some things, but disliking others.our female main character, Daphne Vincent, was one of the things i was liking. she was imperfect and flawed, but also realistic, which was a nice thing to me. i prefer reading stories with characters who are not perfect and have flaws because that makes them feel more human, real, and easy to relate with. of course there were particular things i didn’t like about her and i won’t lie that sometimes throughout the book i found myself getting annoyed at her, but generally speaking, Daphne was not an awful character. not the most remarkable or loveable if we’re being brutally honest — i do wish Emily had given her a more captivating personality, but she was still likeable despite that so i’m not going to complain much. my favorite thing about her character is probably the fact that she is a librarian, how cool is that? she’s living the dream! as for our male main character, Miles Nowak... um, was i supposed to care about him? because i didn’t, sorry. honestly, Miles is not even a bad MMC and i truly had nothing against him — the thing is that i just found him uninteresting and rather forgettable. sure, he was cool guy occasionally and he had a few nice moments, but that’s about it. nothing more to tell you. Miles didn’t have any outstanding or charming qualities in my opinion and i was pretty indifferent about him for the majority of the book. i thought he would win me over eventually, but eh, he never did.the story itself was not the bestest and most interesting i’ve ever read, but the positive thing is that it was keeping me somewhat entertained. even with its issues, i was not bored and i wanted to keep reading more and more. i even started feeling a tad hopeful that things would improve at some point because i could see some potential there. but guess what? it did not improve. in fact, it got worse.i don’t know where exactly things started going wrong, all i can tell you is that after 50% i lost all my interest in the story.i assume it might be because of the romance. Daphne and Miles started having more “romantic” scenes and i was not interested in that. not even a little bit. from the beginning, i couldn’t feel any chemistry between them and their romantic interactions were all so cringe and unnatural to me. just unpleasing to read. so yeah, it actually makes sense why i lost interest when they really started becoming more than friends.i genuinely enjoyed the friendship between these two, their dynamic as friends was fun and sweet, but as a couple? oh, absolutely NOT. when i read romance books i surely expect to root for the main characters to end up together, because duh, but Funny Story made me do the exact opposite. Daphne and Miles should’ve stayed as friends and friends only and i’ll die on this hill. no one can convince me otherwise. it’s not even just because i think they have zero chemistry, there are another million reasons why i think that that they shouldn’t be a couple. the biggest one is that neither of them were very prepared to embark in another serious relationship so quickly (nor they should). they should take care of themselves first and get therapy instead.on top of that, the author also started coming up with unnecessary and tedious subplots. like for example the dad subplot — the most boring — and i just... couldn’t take it anymore. i was getting more and more annoyed and the urge to give up was very strong at that point, but i kept pushing through. i don’t know why, though? it wasn’t even worth it.then... when i thought it couldn’t get any worse... the author throws in a ✨ third act conflict ✨ and what a stupid, irritating third act conflict it was. was it even necessary? it came out of nowhere and the whole thing felt way too forced and annoying. i got so angry at Miles’ actions and i don’t think Daphne was that wrong or immature for reacting the way she did. the conflict just proves my point that they! were! not! ready! for! a! relationship! (well, mainly Miles.)ironically, for a book called Funny Story, this wasn’t funny at all. it’s not the worst book i’ve ever read (trust me when i say i’ve read worse) but it’s not one of the best either... it was just not for me i guess. i still recommend it, though — i feel like others might like it more than me. i certainly hope they do. 𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃 ๋. ₊ ꒰ ✉️ favorite quotes. ꒱ ₊ . ๋ 𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃

— Emily Henry is never beating the ✨ sorcery allegations ✨when she keeps writing my thoughts and experiences. This is The Tortured Poet's Department coded with elements of Midnights in the second half of the book. This book was everything I didn't know I needed and I'm going to need Emily to write more contemporary romance books immediately. — The romance is a heavier focus compared to some of her other work, however it still had Emily's character driven stories, witty humour and introspection. This will be very subjective depending on your own personal connection to these characters and stories but I felt so seen in this book. This was a personal experience for me as it always is with Emily's books and I found it emotional at times. ➳ Daphne is up there with one of the most relatable FMC's for me. She's cynical about love and has been neglected by most people in her life. The romance was a large factor, but Daphne's fear of abandonment, parental issues and cynical nature gave me the emotional depth I crave in Emily's books. Daphne's abandonment issues are incredibly realistic and I got teary towards the end seeing how this has shaped her life. The Prophecy from TTPD this is so Daphne coded as she doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere with family, friends or relationships.
  “You can’t force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don’t. Trust people’s actions, not their words. Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back. Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you. Don’t wait on anyone who’s in no rush to get to you.”
➳ Miles is portrayed as the well-liked and free-spirited personality, however, he has a depth to him once he opens up. He's very patient and in tune with the emotions of people around him. He's an optimist and I loved how he turned Daphne's pessimistic statement's into something positive. I love his personality and banter so I will forgive him for wearing crocs all the time 🫣

➳ Peter and Petra are terrible people. I found Peter especially triggering. He's the guy that always wants what he doesn't have and can't let others be happy without him. Petra got off too easy for her behaviour. ➳ Ashleigh is a side character but she offered a lot to this story. I loved the found family aspect she brought but also her own experiences also added depth to the story. I loved her moment with Daphne towards the end of the book which offered constructive feedback to Daphne's response to conflict. ➳ The romance had me kicking my feet like a love-struck teenager. They were so adorable and the chemistry and tension was palpable. The angst was on nearly every page and while the sexual tension was amazing, it wasn't instant love and their relationship offered so much more than sexual chemistry. They did trauma bond to an extent at the start but it's very clear that their chemistry was not a consequence of the hand they were dealt. This is very loosely fake dating — It could had fallen into so many other tropes but I loved the direction Emily took and she really let the characters stand on their own.
  “I want to kiss you, every time you take a sip of something and make that sound. I want to kiss you every time I walk past your bedroom and hear your laugh through the door. I want to kiss you every time I hear the shower turn on and know that you’re in there. I want to kiss you all the time, Daphne. Sometimes it’s just easier to find an excuse.”
— There's a conflict towards the end and people might have some mixed feelings about it. I personally thought it was realistic because I related to the characters I would have felt the same. I don't pick Emily's books up with the expectation of it being a fluffy. I crave the introspection so I was not disappointed. It goes without saying that her writing is beautiful and witty — she had me laughing, blushing and crying.

"231","194802722","ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalleyi feel like before i can say anything about this book, i just have to let you all know that i was born and raised in michigan (and started this goodreads account in michigan), even though i moved out west after college. but it is also important to know that michigan people love other michigan people! lol like, i am giggling while typing this, but it is also very true and i have never seen another state have this kind of instant comradery before. my family still lives about three hours away from the traverse city area, but i’ve been there so many times, especially during the summer. and this very long prologue of a review is just to say that emily henry really captured the magic of what is a michigan summer and it was absolutely perfect in my opinion. i’m also not sure a book has ever made me miss home as much as the setting of this book, and i just really wanted to emphasize how phenomenally done it was to me, and i would bet a lot of money she has lived there at some point in her life. okay the actual review - i think i can make a dot here: this book is, ironically enough, a story about one person trying to convince another person to build a home and life in a sleepy little michigan city. but let me not forget to type that these two people’s lives have crossed because both of their significant others have decided to leave them for each other! and our main character, after being dumped the morning after her fiance's bachelor party, has nowhere to go because she picked up her life and moved it to where she thought she would finally set up roots. so she moves in with her ex’s new girlfriend’s ex (this feels so hard to type out lol), and each chapter starts with a countdown of how many days until a fundraiser at her work, at a local library, happens and then she will be able to leave. but maybe she can actually still set up those roots after the fundraiser, but in an even healthy and happier way (filled with some good healing along the way). 
  “That's what happens when your life partner leaves you for the nicest, sunniest, prettiest woman in the state of Michigan.”
everyone is going to talk about this book on all platforms, so instead of me telling you more about this book, let me tell you some things i really loved about this story with some bullet points (besides the michigan bias, obviously): ➛ there is a very big difference between niceness and kindness and this book really shows that throughout.➛ as you get older, making new friends can be way harder! and friendship breakups can be just as devastating as romantic breakups! but also, it can be really worth it to let people in, even after you’ve been hurt by doing so with others - maybe especially after that. 
  “You can't untell someone your secrets. You can't unsay those delicate truths once you learn you can't trust the person you handed them to.”
➛ this book also talks about some parental abuse that i honestly do not think i’ve ever read about before, and i know it is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. also the way that miles handles that trauma in the present day was something that really made me feel seen and meant more to me than i have words to put in a review here. 
  “I need it to be okay. Because I need to be okay. As a kid, I just felt so fucking scared and powerless, all the time, and now, I just need to be okay.”
➛ and this is also just such a book about community, and carving out space and safety and love with the people who you trust and want to build a home with. especially when you’ve lived a life of not really having much stability, and the thought of it being taken away makes you scared to start to build it. ➛ libraries will always be the heart of cities, with some of the most powerful tools we have to amplify voices and create change. i am actually typing this up during national library week here, and i just can't emphasize enough how important these buildings, these safe spaces filled with heart, and these librarians are. i would get so emotional when daphne would talk about the kids at her branch, and the books she’d pick because of them. ahhhh, a reminder to just show up for your local library, do donations if you are able (time, books, and money), make sure your library card is updated, just show your appreciation in every way you’re able to. 
  “To me, libraries have always represented the best of humanity. The way we all share knowledge and space, and... and how we find ways to look after each other. It's not a perfect system, but it's powerful.”
overall, this just had so much to love. actually, as i am typing this i am considering making this a five star. I’m just not sure if i loved this as much as beach read, but it is for sure a new favorite emily henry of mine. but miles is for sure the best love interest she, or maybe any other contemporary author, has ever written. and i absolutely cannot wait to watch you all fall with both him, and daphne, and their amazing funny story.trigger + content warnings: drinking, smoking, a joke about suicide, brief mention of fetishization (to a side character and in a negative light), parental abandonment and neglect and and instability in past, child abuse in past, mention of loss of parents in past (side character), one sentence mention of cancer (side characters parent), anxiety depiction, and just a story about people going through a really hard break up that has a little bit of infidelity vibes (even though no cheating did occur to them)♡ evie's amazing spotify playlist blog | instagram | youtube | kofi | spotify | amazon ♡ Beach Read ★★★★♡ Happy Place ★★★",4

I resonated deeply with that of our main character Sophia, and I would have liked to have known more about how her life progressed (even though we did get a brief follow up). In this short story, Sophia is left to take a trip to the Galapagos alone after her boyfriend of six months gets a personal phone call at the airport and says he must go home immediately to tend to one of his adult children. While Sophia does not want to take this trip alone and feels unsure of herself, she gets on the plane anyways. While on the boat in Galapagos, Sophia makes some new friends and learns some things about her relationship that she didn’t know were true. Will things work out for Sophia when she gets home from her trip? Has Sophia grown as a woman and adapted to change while on this trip?

He gets an emergency phone call from his ex wife as they are about to get on the boat - something is wrong with one of their kids. He leaves in a hurry, gives her the camera and asks her to take lots of pictures for him. Sophia is a little shallow to me but Elin Hilderbrand is able to give her character growth in less than 75 pages- kudos to Hilderbrand for that.

Satterwhite proposes that they go on a romantic getaway and then chooses a cruise to the Galápagos Islands, Sophia finds the location underwhelming but is just happy they’re going on an eight-day trip together. But minutes before they’re ready to board their flight, he gets an emergency call at the gate and has to rush home to his son in Oklahoma. She has no choice but to continue the trip alone. the heart of the story…I was a bit skeptical of JP from the onset. He’s older, divorced with two children and works in New York during the week and returns home to Oklahoma on the weekend. Maybe I’m just cynical but an emergency call at the gate? My expectations were low but Sophia having eight days to reflect not only about the relationship but herself was worth the alone time. Being able to step back and look at the lives of those around you, including not only family and friends but the other passengers on that cruise, and then take measure of your own was worth the abandonment. the narration…The author narrates her own story and here it made such a difference as this is a nuanced one that required care and delicacy. She led me where I needed to go. the bottom line…For a short story, it delivered an important and powerful message. While the cruise ship was “rustic” and the amenities on par with a budget motel, there were aspects of the setting and island nature that connected Sophie with its simplicity and beauty. There was a pivotal moment that reset her path and just felt right and serendipitous.

  Darwin’s most famous quote. It is not the strongest of the species that survive, and it is not the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change.
I've never read Elin Hilderbrand before but based on the cover image and looking at the very similar cover designs on all of her novels, I thought this would be very basic chick-lit, but I actually quite enjoyed it. The setting of the Galapagos Islands of course makes it quite exotic and interesting. I have never been and am unlikely to go as I detest hot climates. Sophia is ditched by her boyfriend at the airport just as they are about to board a plane for their week long getaway trip. He is called away due to a family emergency (he apparently has an ex-wife and 3 kids). He insists that she carry on alone and take lots of photos of the various unique wildlife species on the islands and even gives her his fancy camera gear.A photograph of the blue-footed booby. The name of the bird is a running joke in the ""Natural Selection"" story. Image sourced from Wikipedia.But then he ghosts her for the rest of the week! Sophia makes the best of the situation and manages to bond with the various singles and couples on board a rather dilapidated tourist ship. And she discovers her aptitude for photography and the joy of capturing that perfect image.

"242","215950185","First, I have to get this off my chest, because it appears half a dozen times in the story: It's EdmOnd, Oklahoma, not EdmUnd!! It ticks me off when an author doesn't fact check. I suppose there could have been some kind of autocorrect but in that case, proofread!Whew! Okay, better now. This is the second short story I've read where a dating couple has planned a trip, the man cancels at the last minute and the woman goes on the trip alone. Is this some kind of trend? In this case, it was a trip to the Galapagos Islands. It was interesting reading about all the exotic wildlife while the details of the romantic entanglement spun out in the background. If the author hadn't screwed up the city name (I live 40 miles away from Edmond, what can I say, it irritated me), I probably would have given the story four stars. It's not Hilderbrand's best but it is enjoyable.",3

He encourages Sophia to continue on with the trip, and she does, but she can’t help wondering what’s really happened when she doesn’t hear from him.

I was actually surprised to read she was publishing anything because I thought she was ending her writing career, but maybe she was just done with books about Nantucket. Sophia is boarding a fairly 'rustic' cruise to the Galapagos, talked into it by her boyfriend, when he gets an alarming phone call and bails at the last possible second, giving her his expensive new camera. She later finds a list of animals he hoped to photograph stuck in the camera case and decides she will try her hand at taking the pictures herself. She trades cabins with a young couple, taking their bunk bed room, and begins to meet the other cruisers at meal times. Sophia discovers she has an eye for not only spotting relationship nuances (too bad it didn't work for her current boyfriend), but also for photography! She explores seeing things through the camera lens

  The Writing
The title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to ""dance"" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.
  The Worldbuilding
The Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.
  The Characters
Faerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.
  Conclusion
While I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",1
"264","50659467","That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind. Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly. This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf. Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, because it takes all the important themes out and leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section. 2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse). The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical. How is that a punishment at all? She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village. However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed. In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery. So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt. She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here. She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior. Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever. The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity. Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away. Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre. She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc. If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous. Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack* Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever. The result is that the danger does not feel genuine. It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin. Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section. And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is not Shatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha? I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.) Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle. This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love. The answer is love. How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle? She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it. Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her. It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird. People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it. Second of all, if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing. Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse. 🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole. Also, I wrote a rap. It’s called *prim coughing fit* Feyre Darling. Slight spoilers for ACOMAF.

"265","50659467","Clearly I'm in the minority here. DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions of Beauty and the Beast that I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I felt Cruel Beauty among other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like ""ooooooh, so that's why ____."" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book. Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here's this version of Beauty and the Beast, a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely, from the little that I have read.There's Feyre who has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.
  “What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”
A life for a life! Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right? WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.
  “Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”
So what?! Why?! This makes no sense at all. Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother. In exchange, there is absolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.
  Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.
Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape. It doesn't make any sense!
   “There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”
Over and over and over, the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.
  “So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.
And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.
  “My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”
And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.
  “I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”
Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.
  “Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”
As I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.",2

"267","50659467","2 1/2 stars. Maybe my rating comes as a surprise or even - if you care - a disappointment, but let me assure you: no one is more surprised or disappointed than I am. I've had this book on my TBR ever since it appeared on Goodreads without a title, cover or description. I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn't. It is possible I expected all the wrong things from A Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here's what I expected: an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar to Cruel Beauty and other Beauty and the Beast retellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less than softcore erotica. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for. I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre's neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won't pretend I didn't feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn't quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I'm going to compare A Court of Thorns and Roses to Cruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book. In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes in A Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makes Beauty and the Beast such a compelling romance? One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I'll tell you what it is: it's the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability... how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast? We ask. I'll prove it's possible! The author replies. That's why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast. And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it's possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.” Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes action really well. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace. In short: It just wasn't nasty enough. In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I think Cruel Beauty is similar and yet so much better.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",2
"268","50659467","4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺
  This book’s mood song match – Fix You by Coldplay
mum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.
  “Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”
Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books, the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of like Feyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien (the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – the best thing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better was Rhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.
  “His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”
Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after they supposedly fell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much I enjoy this cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.
  “This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”
Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.",4
"269","50659467","I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated. I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own. First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn't make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn't get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn't mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:  1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn't know her way back to the mortal lands 2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to 6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She'll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page. I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn't excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters' behavior. Tamlin's hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,  I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he's a ""nice guy."" No. The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times. Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters. The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre's decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book. Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn't make up for the elements I didn't. I'm hoping future installments will prove to be better. I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on my channel in the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.",2

  The Written Review
:----------Update - 12/6/19
  Should
 I cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:
 Feyre is hunting in the middle of the woods to keep her useless starving family alive (Hunger Games, anyone?).  A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyre on the wrong end of an ancient treaty. She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life - no friends, no family and no freedom. 
  “Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.
At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm - in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory. 
  “Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”
Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under a masquerade curse for nearly fifty years. The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is a blight upon the land . This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucks but keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre is  annoying and obstinate. I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like reading Red Queen). BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested. AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT. Because wow. Seriously wow. Midway through the book, things turned around magnificently. It was like a whole new book. Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing. Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads. Everything makes sense now.  I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, but the Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced. Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one. Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does a complete character shift on you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I am not pleased with the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I am amazed by how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over. So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -

"271","50659467","4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.” I'm speechless. What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE. The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The world Sarah J. Maas created is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!",5
"272","50659467","2.5 StarsOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...I went into this really excited and and really wanting to love this thing. After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn't live up to it for me, sadly. There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels. Nothing really happened and the things that did didn't even make sense until after the book was over. And I'm just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy books while I'm reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear. I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.I did enjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren't enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher, I AM going to read the second book. I trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is ""OMG amazeballs."" And I have faith in ya'll.Plus, I am getting it free from the library, so why not, no?",3
"273","50659467","I approached this book with an open mind and wanted to enjoy it. Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars. A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.",2
"274","50659467","First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn. Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached. It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at. I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself. This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt. Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels. Everything improves drastically in the sequels.",3
"275","50659467","An illiterate 19 year old straight up kills a guy and is outraged when there are consequences. Her punishment is living in a mansion with a hot mayor and hanging out with his friend, the nicest guy in the world and the only character I care about in this series. This is a tragic turn of events for Feyre, as it separates her from her life as an indentured servant to her shitty family. Who’s going to take care of her deadbeat dad, her personality-proof younger sister, and Nesta, Satan’s apprentice? One day a generically handsome man appears and all of BookTok developed a bat fetish overnight. Some stuff happens as Feyre ends up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament from hell where she has to outsmart a worm. Feyre struggles but eventually triumphs due to severe interference from outside sources. This goes on for five books. The fanbase for this series is the size of a large-ish army and if you say something negative about Cassian, they will hunt you down and ruin your life. And honestly, good for them.1/17/24:I have just reread this book and stand by my 3 stars with the addition of how on earth did she figure out the Tamlin-heart thing and not the riddle, which could have appeared on a Bazooka Joe wrapper meant for children? And she fell in love with Fiddle Boy when Lucien is RIGHT THERE? HE’S RIGHT THERE. Whatever Feyre, learn to read.",3
"276","50659467","4.5 stars Tamlin is going to set your loins aflame. Phew! My cheeks are still flushed. I'm also fairly confident this book is going to help change the face of new adult fiction. How awesome to see gifted writers shaping non-contemporary stories that have the coming of age/youthful perspective and vibe of YA books and combine that with the freedom that writing for an older target audience affords them. If you liked the mood and romance of (the excellent) CRUEL BEAUTY but perhaps mourned the missed opportunities of such a seductive premise, ACOTAR more than satisfies.  BITE MY NECK SOME MORE, SIR. Plus stunning action and gorgeous imagery and interesting characters, including a fascinating anti-hero I'm looking forward to learning more about. Serious Darkling vibes, my friends.

"292","199798652","3.5/5 ⭐ 2/5 🔥 ""This might be my favorite romance book, but we’re my favorite love story. ""Yours always, HenryThis felt like a mature version of Icebreaker. And I. LIKED. IT. I want to read icebreaker all over again now.😭This book had no plot, just vibes and an insane amount of good character development. We get to see how Halle and Henry both struggle with their studies and socializing. Struggling with their own personal issues and get better—it was nice to read it all, but after a while it fell off. RomanceListen, everything was excellent. Nothing too excellent. Something was missing. I saw their relationship, but I never sensed a romantic one between them. It was really cosy and friendly! There was hardly any tension between them at all. They were afraid to express their feelings to one another for sixty percent of the book. But even after they got together, I didn't find myself longing for them. 🥲Also that tutor x jock ... ...? this trope? hello? where?I feel like both of them had so many of their own issues. I get it, but still, this felt like they were trying to overcome their own struggles, with a side of romance.I also felt like the convos they had were more like therapy rather than yk the way couples talk. IDK how to explain it, a few times it's okay, but whenever they talked, all they discussed was there issues, and it was just too much..Side characters were same old. The girls group Halle found was SO PRECIOUS. Ugh, need me a girls group like in this one! The sibling-relationship between Anastasia and Henry made me tear so hard!!! 😭 
  Henry always says he’s glad he’s an only child without realizing he has a younger sister in Aurora and an older sister in Anastasia.
CharactersI had no idea Henry had such a complex personality, yk? Similar to the first novel, we got a peek of a very polished to perfection, well-informed person who looked out for everyone around him. However, it was heartbreaking to witness his internal conflicts. With these two MCs, Hannah was able to precisely represent my entire personality. Being a captain put a lot of pressure on Henry, who suffered greatly from ADHD. As I saw him battle to keep up with everyone, I wanted to just step in and give him a bear hug. 😭 
  “Is this okay? If I touch you here?” I ask her when my hands grip her waist gently, She nods, mouth skimming my ear when she leans in so I can hear her. “You don’t need to ask me.” “I do. I should. Men should.”
But even with all those issues, he still managed to be a gentleman with Halle 😭. It's all those small moments!! He made her a whole AUDIOBOOK! A FREAKING BOOK OF JUST HER PAINTINGS! GAH.He is the most gentlemanly gentleman to ever exist in the gentlemen world.
  He sits in his chair again, eyebrows pinched. “I’m sorry.”I lift my nose from the bouquet. “What for?” ""For being the first person to buy you flowers.”
Halle ✋🏻 THE LIFESAVER YOU ARE!!! She was running the whole family!!
  I hate feeling like I’m everyone’s mom when all I ever want when I call is my own mom. Being the eldest daughter is a curse and I’m sick of it.”
First of all, the way first child representation was represented!!! MARVELOUS *APPLAUD*God, her being the elder sibling, simply hit too close to home. She had to take care of EVERYTHING, even everyone's emotions! From assisting with homework to organising trips and such. Her character growth was the best. It was reassuring to see her say no to people. From not being a people pleaser to simply loving herself. The conversation she had with her mother was satisfying 😮‍💨. I was relieved that her mother didn't yell at her, but instead explained the situation to her. Then saying the words that Halle wanted to hear. 🤌🏻🥹The writingWas normal, easy to read. Nothing too complicated. But my main issue was those long ass dialogues! Like they be talking in these paragraphs 😭 and I don't think ppl do that a lot. In every scene where they talked- they talked a LOT with almost no pauses idk how to explainI remember reading Icebreaker, and even tho it didn't have plot, it had fun! The group of boys and those small moments made it so good. But in this, it's all these two characters finding themselves and fighting with their issues, like no parties, no group chats (just a few), almost no banter🥲 I missed it all. I DESPERATELY MISSED JJ, NATE AND EVERYONE 😭Overall it was a cute, very light, enjoyable and a comfort reas. Probably won't ever reread it but still it was a great experience. 🥹*****HALLE JACOBS What’s the code for when you get home and your ex, his family, and your parents have let themselves into your house?

This was shocking for me because it's a Hannah Grace book and I tend to enjoy her books, its not like I didn't enjoy this because I did enjoy it. It's just that it was so meh if you compare it to Icebreaker or Wildfire both of the books had a spark that this one was lacking. Okay so, my ritual while reading a Hannah Grace book starts with leaving your criticizing mind out, by setting your expectations to spicy fluffy romance with minimal plot. It's safe to say it did help me out at times. 
  “God, you sound like your parents right now. People can enjoy reading and still maintain a healthy attachment to reality, Will,” I drawl. “I’m not a social pariah because I like fiction.”
I feel like nothing much happened with the romance in this one?? I am glad that Huda warned me about it but I was like halfway through the book when I saw her saying this lol so I'm a little bummed out about that, My expectations were through the roof when I picked this book up because I had been waiting for Henry's book since I first read Icebreaker and to see got his route made me both sad and mad. Like, dont get me wrong I enjoyed it but I wanted MORE!! Hannah's writing style is very easy to adapt to, it's light and it's easy to read + it's also gripping at times but I feel like for a romance this was very long! like one thing that I liked about the books in the maple hills series was their length becuase it was the perfect length for a romance and seeing that this was 500 was not it for me. The story could hav easily wrapped up on pagee 400 so I dont know why the the next 100 pages existed. I might be critical but I did enjoy the 400 pages lol dont get me wrong I did.
  “Don’t do something you don’t like for other people.”
Henry, he is literally the greenest flag like I have read 700+ books and i have not met a man who scream green flag more than Henry did. He was perfect in so many ways, so respectfula dn so caring the way he noticed tiny details and focused on them and made everyone feel comfortable and learned from his mistakes and did better so other wont be harmed. I also liked his internal struggle as a hockey captain and the way he leaned into support from Anastasia and Nate was so cute, I like how they dealth with it.
  “You’re the period of calm after a storm or, like, I don’t know, a well-fed panda.”
Halle was a nice surprise as well, I liked her! she was shy, read audiobooks at the speed of 2x and was a massive fan of happy place, so everything was perfect when it came to her ohh she also was in a book club! I liked her monologue and her scenes with Henry made the book so much more interesting. I hated her boyfriend and I loved how she dealt with him and I am a sucker for angry confessions so her conversation with her mother was so satisfying.
  “I didn’t know what you like. Anastasia said sunflowers and Aurora said peonies, but I remembered you have a pink dress with tiny daisies on it so I thought they might be your favorite.”
Now the most disappointing part of this book was the romance, they were in love with each other but in denial?? and this went along for so long and tbh I dont even wanna talk about it because it was meh, like the scenes between them were cute but overall I wanted more also was shocked that the spice level was low as compared to the first one. I feel like I was just frustrated with it and it messed with my enjoyment for itOverall, an enjoyable read but also a lackluster read if you compare it to the first two.___HENRY 🙏🏻 PLS GET ME OUT OF THIS ROMANCE SLUMP 🙏🏻__After a little bit of searching I found someTROPES:• Opposites attract• Fake dating 🤭• FMC tutors the MMC• Forbidden love• Dual pov • Hockey team captain x book lover 💜• Spice~~~I wanna say told you so but 🤭 I'll let y'all pass.

"294","199798652","This book was really cute! Henry and Halle are such sweet characters and have such a healthy and heartwarming relationship. Buttt I wanted to feel more towards the romance and towards the book in general. I do think a lot of people will like this book if you enjoy a feel-good romance with relatable characters and not much conflict with the relationship. But for me I wanted more angst or passion or tension or conflict or something. I will say! The characters did have conflict in their personal lives and I really enjoyed those plot lines. I found Halle and her people-pleasing very relatable. And Henry is neurodivergent which impacts his life in so many ways from his relationships to his schooling. I really enjoyed reading and learning about Henry.Overall though I liked Icebreaker and Wildfire a lot more. Very cute and sweet romance though!",3

  ""Thank you for being on my team, Henry.""""Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.""""And how does it make you feel? Now that you can picture it?""""Like I'm living in my daydreams. So, pretty damn happy.""
i know i said this book was going to get me out of my slump, but funny enough, i got out of it before even starting the book 😂 still, i’m sure it would’ve gotten me out of a slump if i were in it. anywayyy, i absolutely loved the first half and couldn't stop reading. i don’t know what i was on, but i was giggling and kicking my feet 🤭 however, when i picked it up again the next day to finish, i felt like i’d lost some of that initial excitement (though the book was still good). it’s kind of crazy how quickly my mood can change, but overall, i still really enjoyed the book. ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ halle the eldest daughter in the family, the “family manager”, and a total people pleaser. halle is easily my favourite fmc in this series so far. she’s so sweet, loving, and caring, and i honestly have 0 complaints about her. i teared up when she finally confronted her mom. no one realized just how much she was struggling inside. i’m really glad her mom listened, understood her, and made an effort to be better. i know her mom only had good intentions and wanted what was best for her, and it goes to show that people won’t know what you’re going through unless you tell them. as someone who used to be a people pleaser, i really empathized with halle. i understand how emotionally draining and frustrating it is to constantly put others' needs ahead of your own, thinking that the only way to be liked is by making everyone else happy.ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ henryhenry is such a gentleman and a sweetheart, and we definitely need more men like him in the world 😫
  “I would have shaved my legs if I’d known you were about to pay extra attention to them.”“It isn’t surprising for me to find hair in a place where hair grows, Halle. You haven’t shattered any illusions for me that women are smooth and hairless.”""...I need you to talk to me if you feel like I'm not stepping up, because I will. I'll do anything for you, Halle. I just don't always know it because sometimes that isn't how I think. I get wrapped up in things and then I don't focus on the outside things I want to focus on. You are a high priority to me.""""Look, I know hockey is your thing or whatever, but... have vou ever considered a professional career in carnival games? Because you're really annoyingly good. And don't tell me you're good at everything, because not every guy can just walk up to a game and win it.""""If he wanted to, he would.""
 you are absolutely right henry 🗣️🗣️🗣️i appreciated the neurodivergent representation in this book. when things got too overwhelming, he struggles to process his emotions and shuts down. he isolates himself, shuts everyone out, feels guilty later, and then spirals even more. he doesn’t understand why he’s like that or know how to stop it, but really wants to, and honestly, i’m exactly the same, so i really empathized with him as well. ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ halle and henryi loved how comfortable henry was around halle, and watching them slowly fall in love was just heartwarming 🥹🥹🥹
  “I like talking to you more than I like talking to almost anyone.”""What're you daydreaming about?""You. Always you. ""Telling Bobby that he has to give up his seat in your car because of your massive duck and it's friends.""
i especially loved how they constantly reassured each other. halle was so understanding, and the way she validated his emotions and feelings was incredibly sweet 🥹 she even helped him with his studies, bought him noise cancelling headphones, etc., which was so thoughtful 😭 henry is just as understanding. i appreciated how he constantly reassured her and reminded her that she didn’t need to apologize, feel bad, or be embarrassed for no reason. i also loved how communicative, self-aware, respectful, observant, and honest he was. i also appreciated that they didn’t rush their relationship and only did it about 70% into the book. it was so sweet how slow and gentle he was with her, knowing it was her first time 😭
  ""What would you do? If you wanted to charm me?""""I'd tell you how fucking beautiful you are. That when you laugh I want to listen to it forever. I'd tell you that when I daydream, I think of us. And all the things I want us to do. And all the things I want to do to you.""""I think that would definitely work.”
the found family trope in this series is one of my favourites, and i’m so glad henry and halle were surrounded by people who truly understand and support them 🥹
  ""I don't like being captain.""""Then why do it? Why not just step down?""""I didn't want to let you all down. You all believed in me.""""Fucking hell, Henry. We believe in you because we love you, you fool. You could tell us you wanted to start, I don't know, fucking show jumping and we'd believe in you. You don't need to be something that makes you unhappy for us.""“My instincts are telling me to say I don’t need their help, that I’ll do it all on my own. But in reality, that isn’t what I want. I need help and I need support, and having a group of friends who offer that is what I’ve always wanted.This whole time I’ve craved more superficial experiences like shopping and getting ready together. I’ve called it girlhood because to me it represented what I missed growing up. What younger Halle desperately wanted. But as we’ve grown closer and our lives have intertwined, I know I was so wrong. This is sisterhood. This is women supporting other women to meet their goals. This is what I’ve yearned for, and I didn’t even know.”“The most important thing that this whole project had taught me is that putting myself first doesn’t mean that I have to do it alone. Having people to help and cheer me on while I did this thing for myself is what made it actually enjoyable in the end.”
overall, this is my favourite book in the series, and i hope we get JJ’s story next <3

"303","199798652","The Maple Hills series keeps growing on me as the author delivers an even better new book that I fell hard for! I've had a soft spot for my sweet boy Henry since the series began, and as soon as I received my ARC, I was over the moon. But expressing excitement at work has its consequences—like when colleagues walk in unannounced and catch you mid-handspring, causing you to lose balance, hit your knee on your favorite rolling chair, and land on the floor in a split! No exaggeration, something close to that happened to me. But it was totally worth it to get an ARC of one of the most anticipated romances of the year.Firstly, the author's heartfelt, genuine, and honest letter at the beginning truly warmed my heart and increased my interest! Her creative writing has reached new heights with each book. Her connection with her true feelings also enhances her character development, making it easy for readers to engage with each character, embracing their flaws, mistakes, eccentricities, and unique antics.In this novel, we not only witness Henry’s character evolving throughout three books but also see a perfect depiction of the author’s blossoming creativity. She gives us unforgettable, easy-to-love characters, each with a well-developed voice.Henry and Halle are the best quirky, one-of-a-kind couple I've rooted for! I loved their slow-burn friends-to-lovers story: how they work on themselves, learn to communicate honestly, and form meaningful relationships, leaving behind their flaws.Their meet-cute happens when Henry accompanies Aurora to her book club meeting to choose leadership books to become a great hockey captain, a consuming job he pours his soul into. Instead of picking a book, he crashes the book club to devour the cookies made by Halle Jacobs: an overachiever, the sweetest person, who struggles with saying “no” to anyone.Henry is impressed not only by her baking skills but also by this pretty, quirky, sweet woman. He discovers she can help him with a class he's struggling in, using her unique teaching technique that worked wonders for her sister Gigi, who also has ADHD.Henry wants to return the favor to Halle, who recently broke up with her egotistical boyfriend Will, a hockey player who gaslighted her into thinking little of herself. When Halle rejected sex, Will ended things.Henry knows Will is a douchebag and that Halle never loved him. He also learns that when they broke up, Halle lost her mutual friends, making her more insecure. She’s always put others first, thanks to her overbearing mother who dumped all family problems on her. For the first time, Halle decides to do something for herself by joining a writing competition that offers a free course in NYC as a reward. This means she has to write the romance novel she’s dreamed of but postponed due to her responsibilities and people-pleasing nature. However, when she sits down to write, she’s blocked because of her lack of romantic experience.Henry finds a way to help by offering to date her without crossing friend-zone boundaries, to help her break her writer's block. Halle agrees, and their ""dating project"" helps both of them break down their walls, exploring their true selves together. Halle starts writing, and the words flow onto the screen. But they had one rule: Halle couldn’t fall in love with Henry. She was sure she wouldn't, but what if their friendship turns into something more? What if Henry starts feeling the same way, feeling unhappy when other guys flirt with her? What if they abandon the rule book and take a chance on happiness together?Overall, this is my favorite book in the series, earning five blazing hockey, quirky lovers stars! I also enjoyed the cameos of my favorite characters and seeing how their stories evolved. This is a must-read, one of the most unputdownable, sweet, and sexy reads of the year that I highly recommend!Many thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me this fantastic ARC, which made me cry and dance with happiness. I highly appreciate it in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
"304","199798652","4 starsI ve been waiting for this book and I can say that it was totally worth waiting.The storyline was much more than I expected,there were lots of points where I felt close to halle,with the eldest daughter problems,her loneliness and with her past relationship.I wasn't expecting this book would make me cry,and make me feel deeper emotions than just romance.But it did.I did my makeup today and it ended up ruining after I finish this book from both sad and happy tears.And for Henry,he is the daydream itself.Other than his kindness and his beautiful personality I loved him because he made halle feeling less lonely even when he was dealing with his own problems.What it bothered me just a little was them not labelling themselves but I understood why they behaved this way.This book has been my favorite out of the series.The smut was proper,not too much and it gave me butterflies while reading.And most of all I'm so happy to see other boys and girls,the family.I missed them",4
"305","199798652","so sad but this ends at a 2.5 ⭐️ spoiler free part of the reviewthis was... disappointing, to say the least. I thoroughly enjoyed Henry's ADHD representation and thought that was done well. Halle was a people-pleaser and had an eldest-daughter curse so she said yes to everyone and everything and didn't know how to say no or put herself first. By the end, I loved seeing her yell and argue and stand up for herself. ➳Their relationship was cute. They were both there to support each other and they had really sweet moments. Was it worth the length of this book? No.➳Side characters are there but everyone seems to be in distress. Nate is away, Stassie is stressing; Aurora is weird and Russ is a teddybear; Kris, Robbie, Bobbie and whoeevr the fuck else exist and I still don't even know who they are three books later (Robbie is in a wheelchair? I never knew this?) The biggest downfall was how BORING this was. Oh my god. I was seventy percent through and the book should have finished then. I want you to be mindful of this: the book starts at the beginning of a fall semester. AND WE NEED TO GET THROUGH TO MARCH for Halle's character arc to be complete. When I read Icebreaker (5/5 stars for me), I didn't notice and/or mind how long it was. Wildfire was a bit of a slog, and I noticed it was unnecesarily long. But this one? Holy moly. SO unnecessarily long. And i love long books! I've read a 700-page fantasy in one day. But please. It took me a week to read this and this was the one release this year I was so looking forward to, and I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. I dreaded the fact that I had to pick this up and read it because I was so bored. 
  
    This part is going to be me ranting, since I'm very disappointed by this book. Spoilers ahead, so beware
  
Since I really did love Icebreaker and even Wildfire, I was so esctatic to get this. But I think my tolerance for the way this author writes has worn thin, between the choppy sentences or weird paragraphs that have no place or rhyme or reason to be there. I kept thinking to myself as I was reading, ""This paragraph could have been deleted and nothing would have changed"" or ""This could have been the leading chapter paragraph and we wouldn't have missed anything."" Because why are you trying to waste my time with these unnecessary, dragging details? There are so many redundant conversations between EVERYBODY.  ➳Russ and Henry—him essentially telling him over and over again that he doesn't need to stress about being a good captain, etc. There's at least forty pages covered on this.  ➳Henry and Halle—I love good communication. not when they are communciating the same point over and over again and getting nowhere. I feel like they went in circles. I don't like labels? You don't either? Cool! You need space? I'll give you space, but I'll be sad about it. Pout pout. Like get a grip.  ➳Halle couldn't stand up for herself to save her fucking life. Like seriously grow a spine.Going into this, you think it's going to be a jock x tutor dynamic and while that is true, it's not the way you think it will be. They essentially befriend each other first, then just spend all of their time together, and then they decide to help each other out. And henry is great—he has a care kit for girls, let's not forget!!—but I wish there was more tension. I felt no butterflies. No fuzzies. Nothing. Because they seamlessly just... fit. Halle lives in her grandmother's house. Yes, you heard that right. Homegirl has a whole ass house to herself that her mother pays for. Unrealistic for a twenty year old, but okay. On the topic of unrealistic things, I truly do not believe Halle had time to do half of the things she always said she had to, nevertheless all of them. And adding onto more unrealistic things, Henry asks his friends (Russ, aurora, etc) to literally help Halle through her laundry list of never ending people-pleasing tasks by grocery shopping for her or buying christmas presents for her relatives. I dont care how good of a friend group you say you have—aint nobody doing all that. Another trope is the virgin trope. Our heroine, Halle, is a virgin. I will reiterate since I think it's important that I do so that I LOVED ICEBREAKER AND WILDFIRE!!!—I thought their spice level was pretty good. The spice in this book is nearly nonexistent. It's also a slow burn, since halle is a virgin. Obviously. And it wasn't even good. Like... Henry. I thought you had more game than this babygirl. I was lowkey embarrassed for the both of them LMAO.And of course, we have Halle's ex boyfriend, Will, who keeps coming back like a fucking cold sore you can't get rid of. Halle literally goes to his house in the middle of the book because her younger sister ends up there, and barely tells Henry. Like girl what? There's also this other subplot for Halle submitting a writing prompt for... whatever reason, hence why she needs Henry's help with getting ""experience"" to write something good. This is the backdrop for the whole book—her trying to get material for her own book (which the premise sucks, by the way, more secondhand embarrassment)—and by the end, it doesn't even get chosen. So all of that for what? Literally everyone dropped their entire lives to help her finish this and it didn't even get picked. Girl don't quit your day job!!! keep daydreaming!!!Now listen. There were good parts. Halle found a group of girl friends which is hard as a girl in your 20s when you're introverted and had your entire life grown around a man. Her and henry's relationship really was sweet, even if emotionally codependent. But it was just so long, so boring, at parts icky and cringey. To say i'm not disappointed by this would be a lie. And it's a 2.5, which is not a horrible rating, but I was really expecting something spectacular. And sure, that can be on me, but when I rated both other books 4 stars and higher, excuse me for having expectations. It's possible I've outgrown this juvenile, college-life style of books. Maybe I don't care about twenty-year old's problems when they're this stupid. The writing is not the best (you don't ""have a shower"" you ""take a shower"") and I might just prefer something with a little more... intellect. My initial review, ""This is going to be so good I just know it,"" could not be more wrong, but I digress. --thank you netgalley for the arc!!!--THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD I JUST KNOW IT",2

"307","199798652","Oh, where do I even begin with ""Daydream""? This book has completely stolen my heart, and I'm not sure I want it back! Hannah Grace has crafted a story that's like a warm hug on a chilly day – comforting, sweet, and leaving you with a lingering sense of contentment.Can we take a moment to appreciate the humor in this book? Grace has a knack for blending emotional depth with genuinely funny moments. I found myself chuckling out loud one minute and reaching for tissues the next. It's this balance that makes ""Daydream"" such a joy to read.Now, I will say that if you're looking for non-stop tension and drama, this might not be the book for you. The conflict here is more internal, with both Halle and Henry working through their own issues. Their romance is a steady, comforting presence rather than a rollercoaster of highs and lows. Personally, I found this refreshing, but I can see how some readers might crave more external conflict.In the end, ""Daydream"" is a book about growth, self-discovery, and the transformative power of love – both romantic and platonic. It's about finding your place in the world and the people who make you feel at home. Hannah Grace has created a story that will stay with me for a long time, and I can't recommend it enough.So, if you're in the mood for a book that will make you laugh, cry, and believe in the power of love and friendship, pick up ""Daydream"". Just be prepared to have your heart completely stolen by Halle and Henry. Don't say I didn't warn you!Thank you @prhinternacional for the ARC",4
"308","199798652","4 ★buckle up guys, i have a lot of thoughts.BUT, we have to start with a quote ofc...
  “Thank you for being on my team, Henry.”“Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.”
this is gonna be a ramble because i don't want to forget my thoughts...so one of the first things i felt/realized in the book is i felt like the author was trying to get us to relate to henry or halle SO MUCH. halle's a people pleaser, and henry has a lot of issues with dating and working on himself. i feel like at times it was super pushed to get us to relate to them, and in a few ways i did.in the blurb, halle is described as a bookworm and her writing her own book for a competition. let me tell you, her being a bookworm does not contribute AT ALL to the book besides a few little mentions. there was a few cute scenes from her writing her book but i wish it contributed so much more than it did.I LOVE HENRY. henry is so adorable... i feel like if you read this as a standalone and not the previous two books you wouldn't be in love with henry as much at all, imo. it's harder to understand him, for example when he tells halle not to cry i feel like you need the backup information from his days before halle.i feel like the biggest reason this wasn't 5 stars is i didn't really care for the romance. i wasn't rooting for them, tbh i felt indifferent. i didn't feel pining or longing for them to get together in the book. yeah, i thought they were cute a few times but i wasn't giggling, on the edge of my seat waiting for them to get together, i wasn't super invested.as a people pleaser, i definitely related to halle which is why i feel like i didn't fall in love with her because she reminds me of myself. not being able to say no, putting everyone before yourself etc. i don't really know how to explain this but i feel like they both had so much issues?? that sounds rude but that's not what i mean lol. i feel like they both needed time to work on themselves especially after halle became friends with henry right after her breakup with will.the timeline was so confusing... there was so many gaps. in one of the first chapters when they meet it's cute and all and then when we get to henry's POV it's talking about him seeing her weeks ago... uhm what were they doing during that?? i need the tea. there's also some gaps in the last parts of the book as well. also, her being a tutor was basically abandoned around halfway through (i don't exactly remember when lol), it just kind of disappears without explanation.overall i gave this four stars because i absolutely love henry, but at times i was genuinely like what when he kept being so “don't cry, halle, it overwhelms me” or him calling her dramatic and it genuinely hurt her 😭 maybe it's because i don't struggle with the same exact things henry does but after a while i was like just comfort her dude 😭BUT THE FIRST 100 PAGES. i thought i was gonna give this 5 stars because those ones were PERFECTTT. anyways guys i'm super excited to see everyone's thoughts when y'all read this 🤭coming back to this 5 minutes later and i want to say how much i appreciate THE LACK OF SMUT. icebreaker gets a lot of hate for it, but this one has more emotional intimacy i feel like since it wasn't a spicy scene every three chapters 🙂‍↕️",4

"312","199798652","✭  3.5 stars    “What’re you daydreaming about?” You. Always you.  Henry Turner is having a rough junior year—he's stuck in a difficult class with a professor he can’t stand and suddenly finds himself as the hockey team captain, a job he didn’t even want. Things get interesting when he accidentally crashes Halle Jacobs' book club. Halle, a super smart student who’s juggling her own busy life agrees to help Henry out with his class, hoping it’ll help her break through her writer's block. As they work together, they make a deal not to fall in love, but sticking to that rule might be harder than they thought. ➸ I thought this book was really cute, but it had the potential to be so much better. I enjoyed it overall, but I found myself getting bored pretty quickly and didn’t feel super engaged with the story at all times. The timeline got a little confusing and had so many gaps. This seems to be a recurring issue with Hannah Grace’s books for me—they’re usually good but don’t quite hit the “amazing” mark. It’s like they have a lot of promise but don’t always deliver the way I hope they will. I think this one is probably my least favourite in the Maple Hills series which is sort of disappointing since I’ve been looking forward to Henry’s book for ages since he seemed like such a sweet character in the previous books. Henry and Halle are both really endearing, and their relationship is healthy and heartwarming. However, I wanted to feel more depth in the romance and the book overall. If you’re into feel-good romances with relatable characters and a low-conflict relationship, you’ll probably enjoy this. It’s a nice comfort read, but I was hoping for a bit more tension and passion. Halle ౨ৎ Halle is definitely my favourite female character in this series! She’s an aspiring writer, a romance enthusiast, and a total bookworm. As the eldest sibling in her family, she’s always been the go-to person—whether it’s helping with homework, organising family trips, or managing everyone’s emotional needs. Her role as the responsible oldest child means she’s constantly putting everyone else’s needs before her own, which is a struggle I could really empathise with. Halle’s journey throughout the book is pretty inspiring. Watching her break free from her people-pleasing tendencies and start standing up for herself was so gratifying. She begins to shift her focus toward self-love and setting boundaries, which is a huge step for her. It’s refreshing to see a character grow in such a meaningful way. One of the standout moments for me was the conversation Halle had with her mother. It was a pivotal and emotional scene that truly highlighted Halle’s growth. Instead of her mother reacting with frustration or anger, she actually listens to Halle’s struggles and offers the understanding and support she needs. This moment was so important because it showed a realistic and compassionate approach to resolving conflicts and supporting loved ones. It made Halle’s journey feel even more relatable and real. Henry ౨ৎ In this book, we really dive into Henry’s complex personality, and it’s both fascinating and heartbreaking to see his internal battles. As the captain of the hockey team, Henry is under a lot of pressure, and his ADHD only complicates things further. Being neurodivergent affects almost every part of his life, from his relationships to his schoolwork. I really enjoyed getting to know Henry better. He struggles with filtering his thoughts and worries about accidentally hurting others, but he genuinely tries to understand Halle and comfort her when she’s upset—even though he’s not the best at handling emotional situations himself. On top of all that, Henry is struggling with one of his classes because the teaching style doesn’t work well for him. He’s trying to juggle the demands of being captain with the need to keep his grades up, especially since his coach has high expectations. This constant balancing act leaves him feeling incredibly overwhelmed. His effort to manage all these pressures makes his character really compelling and relatable.Henry and Halle are such a unique and endearing couple, and I really enjoyed rooting for them! Their slow-burn journey from friends to lovers was captivating, especially as they worked on personal growth, learned to communicate openly, and built a deep connection while addressing their imperfections. Sometimes, it felt like Halle and Henry had so many issues going on in their personal lives that their romance just didn’t get the spotlight. The book seemed more interested in exploring healthy relationships and the value of friendship rather than diving into their love story specifically. There weren’t a ton of romantic moments between them, so by the end, I felt like they were more like really close friends than a couple.  Some issues that I had:  - Halle and Henry’s communication was supposed to be a strong point, but honestly, it felt like they were just stuck in a loop, endlessly repeating themselves. The dialogues were so long they made parts of the book drag on and become pretty monotonous.- There were times when the plot just stalled and felt like it was going nowhere, making the story seem aimless. I kept waiting for something to happen or for the narrative to pick up, but it never really did.- I was really looking forward to the tutor-jock dynamic, but that angle pretty much disappears halfway throughOverall, this book was definitely cute and had its share of charming moments. If you’re a fan of feel-good reads with relatable characters and a focus on friendship over conflict, then this book is right up your alley! However, I couldn’t help but wish for a bit more tension and passion in the story. The lack of conflict and the overall laid-back approach to the romance left me craving more excitement and emotional depth. ♥ Quotes & Moments ♥  ❀  “You always make me feel pretty.” “You feel like that because you are pretty, Halle.”  ❀  This might be my favourite romance book, but we’re my favourite love story. ────⋆.˚ ✩ ⋆˙⟡────༘*⁀➷ pre-read: So excited to dive into this one!

The first thing I want to adress is Hannah Grace what kind of magic did you do? This book was SO GOOD I physically cannot belive this is the same author that wrote ""dicknotized"". The only characters I liked in icebreaker were JJ and Henry so when this book was announced I immediatly wanted to read this, I started reading PRAYING that she wouldn't ruin Henry and safe to say Hannah made me love him even more. NO insta-love, NO smut until 50%, and NO sex until 70% 😦 . I know I probably have low standards for Hannah Grace but I was constantly comparing this to the deal by elle kenedy that has a similar plot and I rated 4 stars and if you liked that one you’ll probably like this one too. I think this is my new favorite hockey romance 🤭. ₊˚⊹♡ Anyways this review is for the girls like me that rated icebreaker a 1 KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN, I promise it's worth it. When it comes out READ IT it's such a wholesome read.⭑.ᐟ 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐓𝐄𝐑𝐒:𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒ 𝘏𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦She is a bookworm, a fellow romance reader, a swiftie, and an aspiring writter. She is the eldest daughter and she constantly stuggles with putting everyone else's needs before her own. People pleasers core, she literally rearanges her whole schedule just so she can accomodate her exboyfriend who is also a hockey player. She is everything to me 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️, and by far the most likeable fmc of this series.𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒ 𝘏𝘦𝘯𝘳𝘺THE PERFECT MAN, not only does he keep a box of stuff in case any girl stays over (which includes cramps pills and hair ties) but he is actually the sweetest man ever. He is neurodivergent and he struggles trying to filter himself so he won't hurt people but he tries SO hard to understand Halle, and even comforts her when she cries even though he's highly uncomfortable with other people crying. He buys her a necklace with his initial on it 😭😭 (yes they share initials but she said it was for him). I could talk about Henry all day long but I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll just say this man has all the love languages, touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, you name it and he does it. I'm quoting my update but he is a man raised by two woman and IT FREAKING SHOWS. ⭑.ᐟ 𝐏𝐋𝐎𝐓: Halle gets broken up at the beggining of this book by her best and only friend named Will, why you may ask? because she won't have sex with him and he as the andrew tate listener that he is decides that he deserves better 💀 (I FUCKING HATE WILL). Anywho, with the break up Halle realizes that all of the people she thought were her friends were actually only Will's, tired of feeling sorry for herself she decides it's finally time to do something for herself. So she enters a writting competition with the prize of a free course in New York. She's writting a romance book, BUT she realizes she hasn't expirienced any of the things she's writting about so she's stuck.At the same time my man Henry is struggling in one of his classes, as he neurodivergent and the teacher's style doesn't work for him so he's struggling. Dangling a position as captain in the hockey team and keeping his grades perfect as his coach won't accept anything less, Henry is left feeling overwhelmed. He is dragged by Aurora to a bookstore to buy leadership books to help with his dilema. There he meets Halle while she hosts her romance bookclub (SHE RUNS A ROMACE BOOKCLUB 😍😍). She offers to help him with his class as she has a neurodivergent sister and knows easier ways to help them learn, and he (as the beautiful man he is) offers to help her too because he doesn't want to ""abuse her kindness"", so in exchange he will help her write her book by giving her the expiriences she lacks.""Thank you for being on my team, Henry.” “Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.”“And how does it make you feel? Now that you can picture it?” He’s quiet while he thinks. “Like I’m living in my daydreams. So, pretty damn happy.”⭑.ᐟ 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐓𝐇𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐇𝐓𝐒: I did NOT expect to like this as much as I did, Hannah Grace you have truly redeemed yourself. This was sweet and wholesome and it is truly impossible it belongs to the same series as icebreaker. I know I shouldn't compare but it's hard not to when the same characters I used to hate are here being nice and normal. Henry and Halle were wholesome, they were sweet, they understood each other and took care of one another, and more importantly THEY COMMUNICATE 🎉🎉🎉 *applauses*. I HATE SMUT SOOO MUCH, but the way it was written in this book made me not hate it and also it was actually a pretty heartfelt scene 😭, he doesn't pressure her into anything like her ex and he is the most patient and attentive man ever.

"317","199798652","FINALLY a five star for August omg. I related a little too much to Halle, like the author was IN MY HEAD lol. Eldest daughters unite. Not me tearing up during the spicy scene. And Henry was the sweetest. I absolutely adored everything about this book! I feel like the author's writing has improved so much since Icebreaker and Wildfire. The previous books were definitely more focused on the romance, while Daydream felt like an introspective character book + college coming-of-age(ish) story with romantic undertones. I really liked how Daydream focused on the hockey less so in a sports way but in a leadership way and Henry's struggles to balance everything. This was also pretty tame on the spicy scenes. There weren't that many, and as aforementioned, I was trying to to cry during one of them. LOL. But I related SO SO much to Halle. I think a lot of readers will see themselves in Halle (as cliche as that is lol) because she struggles with being a people pleaser, managing her family dynamics, forming meaningful friendships, etc. Sometimes I feel like when authors write characters that are people pleasers, the way that it's written seems a bit on the nose and surface level, but that wasn't AT ALL the case here. Halle was a ""subtle"" people pleaser where everyone relied on her for emotional support and she subconsciously feels inclined to give it. And when she said something like ""name something about me that you like that's not something I did for you."" OMG. Now Henry. He needs to be wrapped in a blanket, he's the sweetest book boyfriend. Both he and Halle were written in a way that felt three-dimensional, they had strengths but also flaws. The way Henry cared for Halle in his own unique was was adorable. And I really liked that he wasn't this big macho extroverted hockey player? It's so nice to read a hockey romance book with an introverted MMC who's not grumpy and rude. Also loved how many Aurora and Russ cameos there were. And I feel like perhaps the author is building to a Lola and Robbie book? Possibly with long distance and second chance...?",5

"320","199798652","I think this book was supposed to be about a young woman triumphing over childhood trauma that resulted in her being a parentified, anxious adult but it’s actually about a woman whose only personality trait is that she loathes herself. She can’t communicate for shit, she only grows as a person when other people are forcing her to, and nothing is ever her idea. We are products of our environments, and her environment sucked, so I’m not necessarily blaming her, but that doesn’t mean I was happy to read 400 pages of her not believing anyone when they tell her they don’t hate her. The guy is marginally better - he was raised by lesbians so he’s like, an Ultra Feminist or something - but there is no evidence that Halle experienced any evolution independent of Henry’s guidance and friend group, so what’s the point? There’s a cute cat, I guess.",2

  what is this about?
↳ okay so this is about Miles and Rachel oops sorry, i meant Tate and Miles. Miles being Tate's brother's best friend and Tate being Miles' therapist, ugh sorry, i meant friends with benefits person and the whole time she was hoping he would change his mind because duh she's falling for him while Miles just implicitly leads her on even though he's clear about his rules and pushes her away the whole damn time because of his past but he won't stop their little arrangement because our mans is horny as fuck.also, Miles is a pilot. this is an important fact. ALSO also, this is not Tate and Miles' story- this is Tate + Miles and Rachel's story. i read this years ago and the only things i remember is that Miles got horny while he was wearing swim shorts? (idfk why i remember this don't ask), Miles and Rachel's shower scene (again, idfk why i remember this but i wish i can unsee it thank you very much), and then the Nick Bateman trailer??anyways, that's all i remember and i know, they're all irrelevant but do you know what i forgot?? huh? do you? DO YOU??! well, if you've read this then you can probably guess what i didn't remember because HOLY SHIT- the scene at the end. guys... GUYS. What. The. Fuck.i was speechless- S-P-E-E-C-H-L-E-S-S. i canNOT believe i forgot that scene holy shit. the anger. the annoyance- the fucking rage that i felt when i read that oh my god. anyways, i'm ranting again and y'all know the drill so,･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･ 
  SPOILERS AHEAD
 ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．⤅ dislike #1: Miles' povyou know what, i'm gonna be straight to the point: MILES SEEMED MORE IN LOVE WITH RACHEL. or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it was that intense. now, now. lemme explain.the problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking ✨ s h a k e s p e a r e ✨ 
  She doesn't realize she's everywhere She's in everything Everysingle thing has just become Rachel, It's consuming me.My thoughts aren't thoughts anymore.My thoughts are Rachel.I can't fall in love with you, Rachel.I look at the sink. I want to look at Rachel.I breathe in air. I want to breathe in Rachel.I close my eyes. I only see Rachel.I wash my hands. I want to touch Rachel.
do y'all see this ⤴ ? this is the type of thing i wanted to see from Miles' pov when he's talking about Tate NOT Rachel but we never got to see this until the very end. and then when we get to the present chapters it's 98% in Tate's pov where we see her falling in love with Miles and this is annoying to me because seeing Miles treat Rachel like a goddess in his past chapters and then Miles being a little dickhead in Tate's chapters ugh-energy? not m a t c h e d.and with most of Miles' pov being in the past and falling in love with Rachel, obviously i couldn't help but compare and overanalyze every single thing and think he seems more in love with Rachel. and the thing that annoys me the most is that Tate's present pov and Miles' pov alternates so whenever we read Tate and Miles' romantic progression, the next chapter is Miles being so deeply in love with another woman, it's just...i could've done with just one past Miles pov instead of making it every second chapter or making it 50% of the whole content and showing the way he fell in love sooOOoooOo deeply with Rachel instead of just having 1-2 chapters of his pov about Tate, who's the actual heroine of the book. it's just so bleh and icky the whole time she felt like second best for me and i just felt bad. i know i've always complained about telling >>> showing in other books but this is the only time i'll ever accept all tell, no show.⤅ dislike #2: i can't with the doormat behaviorwhat makes everything more annoying is how Tate just lets him use her for sex and forgives him way too easily all the damn time like bish NO make him work for it for once and stop being a doormat it's annoying (yes, i know i've said the word annoying one too many times but that's how i felt 99.9% of the book OK).
  “If any other man ever treated me like he did, it would be the one and only time. I don’t put up with the things I’ve seen a lot of my friends put up with. However, I find myself continuing to make excuses for him, like something could actually justify his actions last week.”
ma'am pLS-the whole time i was just yelling at her, 
  TATE, YOU ARE NOT HIS THERAPIST
. ugh this pissed me off so much i couldn't even cheer for their romance because Miles was eh and honestly had no redeeming qualities in the present and then reading about his past pov being all in love with Rachel and in the present he just uses Tate for sex and pushes her away quite rudely all the damn time is, again, A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G.⤅ dislike #3: repetitive romanceno seriously. all they ever did was have sex, Tate hoping he would renege his rules and tell her that he does indeed love her and want a relationship with her, Miles pushing her away, Tate forgives him and then they fuck. repeat.⤅ dislike #4: pain. just- P A I Nand then- AND THEN i was just reading Tate and Miles' repetitive interactions where i thought the same shit would happen again and again in peace but THEEENNN.........hold on, lemme just give y'all a moment to breathe.......are you ready? OK
  ""My God, Rachel.""
um excuse me- you're probably wondering, mel, did he really say his ex's name, his ex who we've been reading about in his past chapters and won't shut up about how much he loves this other woman, while having sex with Tate?? well, i don't know let's look at the quote again shall we? are you guys ready?
  He pulls out, then thrusts inside me again, this time with all his strength. It hurts.Give me your pain, Miles.""MY GOD, RACHEL.""My God, Rachel...Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
there. did y'all see that? okay? good. now, not gonna lie with you guys, this one HURT. when i read this scene i didn't know how to feel to be honest. was i shocked? appalled? speechless as fuck? all of the above?? yes. now with this scene, my annoyance reached its peak and is higher than the fucking stratosphere because why you ask? well, it's because there is NO GROVELING!! Tate leaves, Miles lets her go and says it's hard to feel bad for her because she's never felt real pain, then goes to Rachel for closure, goes to Tate and explains his past vaguely and all is forgiven???i'm pretty sure this is where my hatred for hero fucks up so bad but heroine forgives them after one speech trope came from. now, some might say that he gets a pass because of his sad past- because it really was sad by the way - but you see, for the majority of the book we've been reading about how Miles fought for and loved Rachel, and Tate fought for and loved Miles, for once i wanted to see him fighting for Tate but we never got to see that because again, there is 
  NO. GROVELING.
───── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ─────i can't believe i rated this 5 stars back then. i don't know who pre 2019 mel is. we don't know her.honestly, because of the ending, i was this close to rating this 1 star because that's how annoyed i was with everyone but i felt generous today so. as always, i liked the emotional writing and how i can feel the longing and passion between Tate and Miles when they're having sex, the whole ""ugly love"" message, and learning about Miles' past and why he's the way he is?? it was so sad. but overall, everyone annoyed the f outta me (except for Cap- he's the best character in this book), this is basically Miles and Rachel's story, and the ending was unsatisfying as fuck.* * *original rating (july 2015) ── 5 stars",2
"323","17788401","**** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: 6 STARS!!! **** Casting for Miles...  Holy WOW!!! What a beautiful story!!! It was absolute stunning perfection in every way. My heart is just overflowing with emotions ♥Starting with Slammed and Point of Retreat, then with Hopeless, Losing Hope and This Girl, and once again with Maybe Someday, Colleen Hoover has proven over and over again that her stories are unique, powerful and incredibly well written. I have come to trust her writing implicitly. I love the passion she conveys in her words, the depths of the connections she establishes between her characters, and the effortlessly beautiful style in which writes her stories. Without a doubt, she is one of my favorite authors.
  Ugly Love
 is beautiful, sexy, and heart-wrenching. It's powerful, compelling and emotionally charged with a unique storyline that was truly unlike any other I've read. For days after  I finished reading, my mind would drift back to Miles and Tate and relive moments of their story because I just couldn't let go.________________ I fell in love with the story on page one. You might think that the first page is a little early to proclaim undying love for a book but I instantly felt connected -- it was like I'd just stepped right into the story.We first meet Tate when she moves in with her brother for a fresh start where her path quite literally crosses with airline pilot Miles Archer as he lies passed out drunk outside her new place. Despite her initial judgment of his character, she quickly learned there a whole side of himself he was hiding from the world -- a deep, bottomless pit of pain and sadness.She wasn't looking for a relationship and he wanted nothing to do with love but they had an undeniably powerful attraction towards each other. Drawn together, but unwilling to give themselves wholly over, they agreed to a friends-with-benefits arrangement following Miles' two, unwavering rules that would forever keep a distance between them.
  “Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”  
The more time they spent together, the more complicated things became as the lines between friendship and love began to blur. As Tate began to give her heart over, Miles fell further away. The pain of his past was so great that he never again would allow himself to fall in love. Not for any reason, or for anyone.
  ""It's not that I don't like you, Tate… I just don't 
  want
   to like you. I don't want to like 
  anyone
  . I don't want to 
  date
   anyone. I don't want to 
  love
   anyone.""
However even through the most painful and ugly times, there's a healing power to love. This story left me emotionally drained but on the most amazing book high you can imagine. It was a powerful journey that showed how even after the worst possible devastation, love can always find a way.________________ Every single moment while reading this book, I was feeling something, and feeling it strongly. It was thrilling, mysterious, sexy, alluring, emotional, it was everything in the exact perfect balance. From the start, it was clear that we were not seeing the full picture so each scene gave us another piece of the puzzle that was Miles' past. Everything just made me want to know more. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!Miles was such an intriguing character to try and figure out. Enigmatic. Mysterious. Smart. Sexy. Sensitive. His past so full of pain that it shut him away from wanting any hope for his future. Not only was he unable to move on, but he genuinely didn't want to.... and he was willing to do everything in his power, to sacrifice anything, to never again have to experience so much pain. Seeing him struggle internally with both his aversion to love and his growing attachment to Tate was just heartbreaking. His pain felt so real that I can honestly say, I've never wanted to hug a fictional character this much before.
  ""Tate,"" He says in a pained whisper. His face moves to my neck, and one of his hands grips my waist... His other hand moves to the back of my head as his lips rest against the skin of my neck. ""What do I do?"" He whispers. ""What the fuck do I do?""
We were shown the story through both Miles and Tate's POVs in a mix of both present day storylines and flashbacks. The present was told from Tate's perspective and, because of how mysterious Miles was, we got to see flashbacks from his POV six years earlier. And as these little pieces of his past slowly began to line up with his behaviour in the present, I was able to begin putting together the real story he was hiding.He kept so much hidden that all the little things between them -- the hint of a smile, the stroke of a thumb, a quick glance -- became so much more powerful and meaningful. And because of the build up of all these little moments, when Miles and Tate finally got together it was explosive!Dear long-time CoHo fans, be prepared for hotness!!!!!  This is a whole new side to Colleen Hoover's writing and let me tell you, it is sexy and steamy!!! Trust me, you will be fanning yourself ;)
  ""The couch or your bed?"" he whispers.
  ""Both,"" I reply.
But on a more serious note.... The more I read, the closer I got to discovering the source of Miles' pain and when it hit, it was gut-wrenching!!! I can honestly say that few character's backstories have ever made my heart shatter as Miles' did. I cried -- no, sobbed -- so much that I could no longer see the words and so I just sat there with tears steaming down my face absorbing the huge emotions this story evoked.
  ""If I were capable of loving someone… it would be you.""
  I want to promise you though that this story is worth every tear because the way all the pieces of the story come together was absolutely gorgeous. The ending will leave you with a joyous feeling but the journey to get there is not an easy one. It's beautiful but so broken. Ugly love.________________ I've read the book twice now and I know I'll be reading it many more times to come. I have the book hangover of the century and I'm finding it hard to let go of Miles and Tate because of how strongly I connected to them. Truly, I don't think there can be greater proof that this was a wonderful book.I've loved every book Colleen Hoover has written but this one is my favorite. Ugly Love is a must-read book of the year! I loved every word, I felt every moment, and I will never forget this story.I don't give out a lot of 6 star ratings (in fact this will be the first one I've given this year) but the truth is that this book went above and beyond. The story was powerful, the writing was stunning, and the way every single piece of it was woven together was simply breathtaking.Rating: 6 STARS!! Standalone romance.And... I still want to hug Miles ♥ Release date: August 5, 2014._____________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦ Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦ Facebook Blog Page✦ Twitter",5

I HATE YOU BUT I LOVE YOU! YOU RUINED ME AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH! IF YOU CAN'T GUESS IT BY MY NON STOP CAPS THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THAN SCREAM ""I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!""WOW JUST WOW! I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHEN I'LL GET OVER THIS BOOK HANGOVER. 
  Ugly Love was nothing like I expected it to be. I excepted it too be like a 50 Shades of Grey fan fiction with just a butt ton of thrown together steamy scenes... No, it wasn't it was so much more. I knew I was going to like Miles (because he sounded so hot), but I had no idea that I was going to love him. That he was going to have an actual back story... That he was going to be actually interesting in a realistic way... I had no idea he was going to break my heart.All that being said I have a few bookish confessions to make before I really get into the review, I choose to read this book 1) because I heard it was becoming a movie and if there's anything I love nearly as much as reading it's seeing movies 2) because this is who they have playing Miles:
          
      
    
    
    
      Yeah I didn't notice the dog at first either...and 3) I also need to admit that I didn't get what was so appealing about this book that it was actually going to become a movie... I get it now. I get all the hype and talk surrounding this book. I have NEVER, EVER, EVER cried so hard in a book. That's the very last thing I thought this book was going to make me do.The characters in this book felt so real. Tate was naive and normally that would make me wanna punch a B, in her case it made me love her. Unlike most leading ladies she isn't overly sassy, or has incredible lol rebuttals,she was realistic. Her brother Corbin, OMG CORBIN, I loved every single thing about him. He has to be one of my favorite sub characters ever. He was what I imagined a brother would be and even with him not being a constant character just his presence had me. Then there's Miles and he is hands-down the star of this book. The moment you meet him you hate him. He is a mysterious mess and I thought he was going to annoy me fast. He won me over once they started going into his back story. The further they went into it the more I could feel what was coming... Yes, I knew where this story was going and what was going to happen but in no way, shape, or form was I actually prepared for it. I was a blubbering weeping ball of emotions.The switch between time and POVs was done flawlessly and revealed the perfect information at the perfect time to keep you hooked and wanting more. Colleen set up this story so at first you would only like Miles because of his looks (which I've already made clear I was guilty of)...""his shirt isn't buttoned. I'm staring at his stomach. Oh my word he has the V. Those beautiful indentations on men that run the length of their outer abdominal muscles, disappearing beneath their jeans as if the indentations are pointing to a secret bull's-eye."" And yes, he is a looker, but by the end I could have cared less about what he looked like. He could have worn a bag over his head for the last half of the book and my heart would have still been his. The relationship between Tate and Miles is like nothing I have read before. It was something else that really surprised me about this book. Saying it was complicated would be an understatement. I thought that the steamy scenes were going to take up most of this book, but it didn't... Yeah that's something that would normally make me rank a book lower, but the scenes were so well written and again realistic. They were well placed and well thought out. Just enough to make this book not ""too much"" which is what had me falling hard for this read way harder than I anticipated. The scenes are hot though like dump a bucket of water on your head hot. Miles and Tate's conversations roll so smoothly and the moments between them are so; I don't even know a word for them, they're just perfect (that word really doesn't do justice). Not only is he romantic but he made average things so hot. Orange juice is hot, rugs are hot, scrubs are hot, and curtains are so so hot. whoosh.Honestly though the scenes that turned out to be my favorite were just ""average scenes"", like when they all go and visit Tate and Corbin's family for Thanksgiving. That whole section had to of been my favorite. I loved how I thought this story was going to be Tate's but turned out to be Miles'. I love how I thought this book was going to be a light sexy read but turned out to be a heartbreaking love story. I just loved how everything came together while falling apart.. Because when all Miles story is finally shown and is laid out in it's fullest I was basically like this...I want to rant and rave even more about this book, but this is something you really need to read and experience for yourself. Ugly Love might just be the biggest surprise read I've had all year. I can't express enough how impressive the characters, plot, and play out of this story are.I didn't think that this book was going to be so hard on me... And yes, it hurt. And yes, it was a total sobbing fest, but that ending... Good golly miss molly.. That ending was perfection. I don't know if I can ever forgive Colleen Hoover for what she did to me, but God dang it I love her so much for it. I didn't see this coming and I've never been so happy to be emotionally slapped in the face like I was reading this.",5
"325","17788401","If you're a fan of the book, please don't read this review. It's going to upset you, and then you're going to hate me and leave mean comments, and then we can't be friends anymore. It'll be awkward all around. So yeah, best avoid.Seriously, last chance to turn away.Okay, now that I'm among like-minded readers (all three of us who didn't like this book), what the heck was this? Was Colleen Hoover blackmailed into putting her name on a book written by a hormonal teenager? Because I can't comprehend any other explanation for the hot mess that was this book.Gosh, where to even start? How about with Tate and Miles, our main couple. So they meet and it's lust at first sight. But Miles can't do relationships because some unexplained thing has hurt him in the past. So now he can only have no-strings-attached sex. (Cue eye roll.) Of course, Tate can't say no to such an amazing offer, so she jumps right in. (Another eye roll.)Sure, the premise is a bit wack, but not all hope is lost. The characters must at least be likable, right? Well, no. Miles doesn't talk or smile, which is mentioned at least once on every single page. In fact, he smiles so rarely that Tate composed a poem on the one occasion he did:
  Miles smilesFor no one elseMiles only smilesFor me.
If you're wondering how anyone could possibly fall for a nonverbal, expressionless man-child, your guess is as good as mine. Then we come to Tate, the world's biggest pushover, letting Miles walk all over her and treat her like a sex doormat. Yet she keeps going back for more, reeking of desperation and utterly devoid of self-respect. Lest you think this makes for an exciting story, I assure you there's a reason why silent/clingy has not taken off as a popular romance trope.
  I want to plaster those four words on a billboard and require myself to pass it on my drive to work every day.
You'd think he promised her the moon and the stars, but no, he just said, ""You look pretty, Tate."" I kid you not.We also have interweaved the story from Miles's younger years, the one that explains his pain. He and Rachel are young and in love, but things keep getting in their way. It definitely makes for very angsty (shudder) drama. But that isn't my biggest issue. My biggest problem is that it's written like this:
  Rachel is happy.I make Rachel happy.I make Rachel's life better.Her life is better with me in it.""Rachel,"" I whisper.
Is this a joke? And here's another example:
  We go to the beach.Rachel wants to sunbathe while she reads.I want to watch Rachel sunbathe while she reads.
In case you think I cherrypicked the most ludicrous examples, those are actually from the same page. In fact, every page written about Miles and Rachel reads like this. And it has the most ridiculous formatting, with line breaks galore, everything center-aligned, and random italics thrown in for emphasis.Why is the writing so juvenile when Miles is supposedly 18 years old? Why is every scene between the two couples so cringeworthy? And why isn't this book called ""Idiot Love"" instead? I don't have any answers, just questions.As I was reading this, I kept feeling like I was on some hidden camera show, and any moment, someone would jump out of the bushes and yell, ""Gotcha!"" Then they would hand me the real book written by Colleen Hoover, and we'd all have a good laugh over how thoroughly they got me. But sadly, that didn't happen.I have a love/hate relationship with Colleen Hoover, and this one unfortunately falls squarely in the hate category. Since I've read most of her recent books, I thought I'd catch up on some of her older ones. But that was clearly the wrong decision. Maybe she's one of those authors who gets better and better as they go, and this is just too far back from her current style to resemble even a little of what I love about her writing.And one last closing thought: if you're a young woman (or young man) reading this, and you think this is the way love is supposed to be, just no. You can have spark and sizzle and lust, and still be treated with kindness and respect. Don't ever let someone walk all over you and don't ever settle for less than you deserve. Tate should've kicked Miles to the curb a long time ago. If she had, this would've been a story worth reading.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us / It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouLayla ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",1
"326","17788401","2 stars!First, I really have to thank my good friend Geri for buddy reading this with me or I would’ve taken a screwdriver to my eye long before I finished this book. I honestly have 
  nothing
 positive to say about this book so I’m going to put all my complaining in a spoiler tag so I don’t purposely hurt anyone who loved it. Usually when I read CoHo books, I am instantly hooked and transported into whatever world she’s created. I love that about her writing and very few authors can accomplish that feat again and again. However, it’s not a good sign when I’m only 10% into this book and I feel ranty and restless. Here’s why:I.Did.Not.Appreciate.Or.Like.This.Kind.Of.Writing.That.CoHo.Used.Nearly all of Miles’s POV chapters were styled this way and quite frankly, I don’t get why. Is there some poetic, swishy-swashy, twirly message I’m supposed to get? I understand that for some sentences to be broken up like the way it is above can convey emphasis and I’m all for that, but it’s overkill to repeatedly use the same writing tactic. Reading shouldn’t be a chore, and it’s never been a chore to read CoHo’s books but for this one, it was. My main problems with the book, however, are the main characters: Tate and Miles. To put it bluntly, I. Did. Not. Care. About. Either. Characters.TateSome may find Tate’s actions to be realistic and appropriate considering her situation, but her lack of self-respect was just disgraceful to read about. I don’t care if it’s all in the name of love. Miles didn’t even love her for most of the book until he “came to his senses” and she lets him walk all over her. Additionally, her relationship with Miles reminded me of a child trying to please an adult.“He just admitted that he wants to have sex with me; he just doesn’t want it to lead to anything. I don’t know why this flatters me. It should make me want to punch him, but the fact that he chose to kiss me after not having kissed anyone for six straight years makes this new confession seem like I just won a Pulitzer.”“Say the word ox.(Miles says the word ox)I smile. I love the word ox. It’s my new favorite word.”Essentially, everything Miles says is beautiful and noteworthy. *gag* And quite frankly, I really don’t see how Tate falls in love with him when she doesn’t know anything about him. Except that he’s dark, broody, and silent most of the time. Oh and did I forget hot?  insert sarcasmMilesI read some early reviews so I was dying to know about his past and why he couldn’t love another but when I found out, I was severely underwhelmed...I mean, seriously?????? Part.Of.The.REASONIs. Because. It’s.REVEALEDIn.  This.Manner.I’m not a cold fish if that’s what you’re wondering and I have bawled like a baby before while reading heartbreaking book scenes, but this reveal did nothing for my emotions. All I felt was a sense of urgency to quickly finish the book and get it over with. Oh and Miles visiting Rachel to “confront his past?” That was so LAME! Basically, if Rachel wasn’t living happily with a new family, Miles wouldn’t have been able to move on. Guess it was soooooo convenient that she was able to move on which made Miles feel free to love Tate. BULLSHIT!I’m not even going to bother going in-depth with all the times he’s hurt Tate and callously brushed her aside but the one scene that made me hate both characters was during sex, Miles calls out his ex-girlfriend’s name and Tate just tells him to finish. WTF. In hindsight, I think this wouldn’t have been a big deal but from the beginning, the annoyances have been building up and that scene was the last straw.So a recap:Hated both MCs, Tate and Miles.Hated the writing style.Hated the unoriginal premise of the story (friends-with-benefits).Hated the clichés scattered throughout the story.This is why I have nothing positive to say about this book. Well, I like the cover. Does that count?Everything this woman has written, I have enjoyed reading but it’s too bad that this time, CoHo wasn’t able to win over my emotions. Out of author loyalty and because she wrote the Slammed series (one of my top favorites), I’m going to give it 2 stars when I really want to smack one star on this book.

  I know most of my GR friends–in fact, most everyone–loved this book, so please don't throw rotten tomatoes at me. I wish I could say I loved it, too, but I can't. When I read a romance, I need to FEEL some semblance of that romance. I need to LIKE at least ONE of the characters. If that's not possible, I need to be able to at least SYMPATHIZE with one them. Unfortunately, I never once felt the romance, and I could neither like nor sympathize with either one of the characters. As this story progressed, I found it impossible to like the hero or the heroine when I felt neither one of them deserved respect or admiration. The hero, Miles, treated the heroine, Tate, with such blatant disrespect it was appalling, all the while wallowing in self-pity and self-hate to excuse his behavior. It was PATHETIC! Then there was the heroine, Tate, who had so little respect or dignity for herself when it came to the hero, that she continually allowed him to use and treat her like a PIECE OF TRASH. Again, PATHETIC! I did have to give her some kudos for the fact she was honest with herself and admitted she allowed him to treat her so abhorrently. As for the romance, for me, it was nonexistent. I found it impossible to feel any romance when most of the hero's POV took place six years in the past. His POV did give light as to why he was so broken, but also focused on how completely, madly, and hopelessly IN LOVE he was with ANOTHER GIRL. So basically, the whole book was the hero showing love and respect to his first love, while treating the heroine, with her blessing, like trash. I don't care that Miles had a tragic past; the world is full of tragic pasts! There is NO EXCUSE for treating another so cruelly! It was UGLY, which I guess was the point of the story, but I certainly did not enjoy reading it. Colleen Hoover is a very talented author. Her characterizations are consistently outstanding and she has such a beautiful way with words. My respect and admiration for her work is the ONLY reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one. Oh well, you can't love, or even like, them all.",2
"328","17788401","This book was miserable. It goes toe to toe with Hopeless for the worst book I’ve read by her. There are three things that I think went horribly in this book. First, there is blatant sexism and the perpetuation of gender stereotypes on every. single. page. Second, this main character had absolutely NO self respect. I know this may be part of the plot, but it was absolutely despicable. She let Miles walk all over her and decimate her feelings to a pulp. She was spineless and pathetic, which was infuriating. Even when she would say or think something sassy, she would NEVER follow that up with real actions. But lastly, and probably most significantly, the way that this story is told was just twisted. The main conflict in the book follows Miles. It’s about Miles’ tragic backstory and how he comes to terms with that and how he can never love again. Why, then, does this story attempt to revolve around Tate? She is completed subordinated to Miles, and she’s the main character!!!!!! Tate was pretty much a doormat this entire book for Miles to walk across as he sorted his own issues out. And she tries to sell this as a book about two people in a relationship just for sex? No. It’s manipulative, it’s one of the most UNHEALTHY relationships I’ve ever read about, and it gives off COMPLETELY disgusting messages to young women reading this book. Colleen always writes books that deal with mentally destructive topics, and each and every time it is always done SO unhealthily and wrong. Every time I read a new Colleen Hoover book, it genuinely shocks me that people rate them so highly.",1

  I hate being in a minority when it comes to books. I wanna be able to love or at least like the books that most of my friends love. Furthermore, there is no other book I would really love to have the same feelings for than this book because it's CoHo, you guys. I love CoHo. But.But...I.Didn'tLove.This.One.
  I wish I did. Most of the things that bothered will be reflected in the way I'm writing this review.Can.You.GUESS.What.It.Is?See, I could forgive Tate for being a doormat during most of the book. I really could. While I don't understand why she allowed herself to be treated that way by Miles, I was willing to overlook it since I've enjoyed doormat-y heroines before. I mean, whatever floats your boat, Tate.But the writing just threw me off. Sent me on downward spiral through.......PURPLE.Hell.The 'lyrical' prose did not work for me. If you can call it lyrical. To me, it was just repetitive.I'm sorry. But it was. My father is Lisa’s new boyfriend. My father visits Phoenix a lot. My father has been visiting Phoenix a lot since before my mother died. My father is a bastard.If it isn't repetitive, it's too flowery. I come from the School of Less is More when it comes to my prose. Suffice it to say...This.Annoyed.The.Crap.Out.Of.ME.It was a chore to read. And honestly, it did not lend itself well to Miles' POV. I mean, this doesn't sound like an 18 year old male.
  Does it sound poetic? Yes. Is it romantic? Sure. Does it feel authentic? Nope!I would probably felt more of Miles pain had it been written in a straight-up, no BS prose. I wanted it raw and gritty. I wanted the words to hurt. I didn't want to be lulled to sleep by it. Frankly, if I'd wanted to read poetry, I'd read a poetry book. I didn't hear Miles through the narrative and because of that, I became disconnected with his character. I wish I could have gotten more of his POV in the present. I really do. And didn't like that his past was told separately from what's going on in the present. I never really got the satisfaction of seeing Miles tell Tate about what happened to him. Maybe I would have felt something then. Again, I'm in the minority with this but that's just really how I felt about it.I did like parts of it, hence the two stars. I like how the message of how the ugly side of love is sometimes worth experiencing to get to the beautiful parts of it. But Tate and Miles relationship didn't really evolve for me. I think Cap and Tate spent more meaningful time together than Miles and Tate, which is really sad.

{MY RANT}Someone, please explain to me why everyone hates Miles? Now don't get me wrong, i don't like the guy either but i perfectly understand the cause of his actions. Did he ever promise Tate ""true love"" or any other shit? No, he offered fucking with no attachments and no sentimental bullshit, and that is exactly what he delivered. I don't see what the problem is here. I despise Colleen Hoover for romanticizing this kind of behavior. Like, ""once i get him to sleep with me I can trick him into talking to me."" or ""maybe if we fuck daily he'll eventually fall in love with me."" Ugh are you fucking kidding me? Am i the only one who can't stand women like this? Bitch, please! Self-respect, you need some in your life. Trust me when i say i really wanted to like this. It started out great but after about 70 pages everything went downhill. I feel like there were lots going on at once, but none of it was original. I've read better. -Brooding jackass meets a goody goody.-Step siblings messing around.-""No stings attached sex"".Despite it's unoriginality, it could've still been enjoyable were it not for our main character, Tate, who i hate with a passion. She ruined this entire book for me. Man, i don't think i've ever read a character this stupid or this exasperating before SJM characters aren't included . . and i've read my share of idiotic characters. Was i supposed to be on her side? Was i supposed to feel bad for her? I could clearly see why Miles sees her nothing more than a good fuck. She has no respect her herself. I feel nothing for her and Miles as a couple or fuck buddies. The sex scenes were extremely boring and tedious.I pretty much skipped most of their parts.. which is the entire book, sadly. I was so fed up with her bullshit. For me, it was always Rachel and Miles. I was always looking forward to the flashbacks. The only reason i didn't DNF this is because i was so hooked on ""WHERE IS RACHEL?"" or ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO RACHEL, MILES?"" I hated HATED the ending. How the hell do you move on from something like this? They belonged together. This is possibly the last book i would read by Colleen Hoover. It's more than obvious her and i don't get along. However, i am low-key curious about Maybe Someday. Maybe I'll read that one as well but i am in no hurry.

"347","17788401","There's one thing I don't understand with romance novels.. When the characters and plot doesn't actually remind me of a love story. This is pure lust and obsession. There's a trope that everyone is familiar with: the man who doesn't want to commit and the woman who wants to change him for the better. It's not new, it's not exciting, it's just boring. This one had it all and I was terribly not impressed. Sprinkle that with sex scenes and this is what you get. I was more interested in Miles' past and I had many theories, but I wasn't truly accepting of him being super in love with a girl he laid his eyes on for 5 minutes. He literally falls in love at first sight. But if you read it, it's more like an obsession. “She's in everything. Every single thing has just become Rachel. It's consuming me. My new favourite flavor is Rachel. My new favourite thing is Rachel.”I was expecting a shrine dedicated to her. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes.. Not only is Miles the wounded hero with the tortured past, he was also just blah. This man had no expression and I get he had an invisible wall but still.. I just couldn't find his character attractive.Tate is also just as bad in my opinion. She will literally talk about how his hand is touching her or his foot or knee and I could not keep my eyes from rolling. Please just stop Tate. You are attracted to his body. You barely know a thing about him and you say it's love? This isn't love. It's lust with a little bit of like. You like him because he's mysterious and I applaud you for not giving up on him but really??? A relationship hardly starts with just sex involved.More quotes from Tate:“I'm not Tate when I'm near Miles. I'm liquid, and liquid doesn't know how to be firm or stand up for itself. Liquid flows.”Tate is literally obsessed with Miles. Miles used to be obsessed with someone else. Definitely not a love story I would enjoy. I'm upset I didn't like this more but the characters were all tortured and obsessive and addicted to one another. We all know that is not remotely healthy at all. I just also didn't care about them. It was all lust and sex. Where was the romance?? And that ending????? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? After 6 months??? Ugh I did not find it entertaining at all. I was bored and pretty much sped read through most of the sex scenes.First time reading Hoover's work and I had such high expectations, maybe I should have started with another of her books because I'm seriously disappointed.RATING 1/5QUOTES""I've always found guys more attractive when they put less effort into trying to appear attractive.""

Wow!! Ugly love is amazing!! I absolutely loved it!! It is the 3rd time I read it and I still cried even though I knew what's going on..It all started when Tate moved in with her brother Corbin.

It started off decent and interesting.  I liked Mallory,  her looking out for her family and siblings was something that resonated with me on some level. I liked her relationship with her sisters and how selflessly she gave for years and years. Sabrina and Darcy were okayish. I liked Sabrina better, as Darcy was all over the place. Look, I know it's not a fair comment given she's just 12 but am gonna tell you why she pissed me off, or rather Ali's writing pissed me off.  I found the book after a 100 page mark to be boring and getting worse.  Although I liked the chess elements and it was interesting enough to keep me reading, but I didn't sign up for chess alone. I thought I was promised romance too, on which I'll elaborate further. First, I'll come to  Nolan.  Was he there in the book? Oh, he was? Where? Oh, he was the love interest. Was there a blossoming love? Oh, there was... Where? Basically, he was so basic, he is forgettable. He has the personality of a rock. The man has no expression. I couldn't care less if he had something to say or not, which mostly he does not. He just pouts, glances, glares and that's his day.  The romance did not come across as romance,  or even a budding one at that. Mallory and Nolan had minimal chemistry. They came across as colleagues throughout the book and nothing more. Their interactions were made to appear as something deep but it really wasn't. Coming to my not so favorite topic- Ali's writing.  I know it's her first YA book but it came across as trying TOO hard. The overloading of unfunny jokes was just cringe worthy. The gen Z references were never ending. But the worst of all was how she wrote about sex.  Now, I know this might be perceived as unpopular in today's world but YA does not need to have a lot of sex talk in it.  Few sentences, one or two paragraphs talking about it in a mature and tasteful and educational manner is fine. But when the 12 year old character starts pestering the adults to talk about their sex life while talking about her adult sister's sex life to a man she just met, is just creepy, and sends a wrong message. Sure, teens talk about sex and make sex jokes- but amongst themselves. Not to some random guy they have just met!! Also, why is there so much sex talk in this book when the targeted audience is not NA.  I might be a bit old school here but I stay firm in my position- LET YA BOOKS BE YA!!  Authors must be cautious in how they deal with sex in this genre. You either fade to black, have a short but non descriptive- tasteful scene, or just let it be for an educational and learning purpose. Ali Hazelwood might have the talent to write but she did not have the substance to write. The decision to read this book is your own, but this one was not for me and in my view, there are much better books out there. ~•~•~Now this one looks refreshing and promising. Doesn't seem like the TLH 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 so all good. Besides the cover is too cute to pass off",1

"355","60683957","3.5 stars! I’ve loved Ali Hazelwoods past books & was so excited to read a young adult book by her! It was so fun getting immersed in the world of chess!! A career/sport that I knew little about. I love that the characters felt like complex characters outside of just their romance plot. Mallory’s got a tough family backstory and home life and two very fun little sisters. I also loved Nolan! He’s a chess god, incredibly handsome, and so sweet 🥹 🫶🏻 BUT I had 2 big complaints. Mal definitely had some self destructive tendencies which felt similar to the miss communication trope to me (in that it was very frustrating & I feel like there are way more interesting conflicts out there). And secondly! The ending ended so SO so abruptly. I was so disappointed. I wanted more from the romance and chess tournament in the end. Even a better epilogue would’ve worked for me. Overall a cute chess filled young adult romance ♟️ 💗",3
"356","60683957","3.5⭐️ Definitely had fun reading this but it’s not my fav. Nolan is a cutie pie and deserves the world. Also I’m confused on what qualifies a book as YA LOL",4

  *deep breath* mal was very meh. nolan = adam carlsen 2.0 and i think i need a restraining order because he creeped me out with the whole talking about sex with her teenage sisters and telling mal what to feel and his whole backstory was that his grandad tried to kill him and then it's just never touched upon again. oz=hilarious. if my personality doesn't scream ""defne"" i have failed life, surprising exactly no one. sabrina was such a bitch she needed a good slap - her only redeeming quality was the schrodinger joke. the blabbermouth sister was forgettable considering i don't even remember her name (tis darcy). and koch was a misogynistic dick who was a very hateable villain. i might be dumb but i guessed that twist with him AND the solution to that twist miles away, lmao saffiyah 1 book 0 (although i bought and didn't dnf this shit so who's to say who's winning - although it is definitely unfortunately the book). and with easton i don't get it, why was she absent for like half the book? when she was first introduced i thought we would actually see their friendship and then she just ghosted her when she went to uni, girl what was the point of that? and there were more characters that i just could not care less about *exhales*__someone told me that they love the lists in my reviews, and i crave validation so here we are with all the things i hated:1. large hands...“taking his hand. It completely engulfs mine.” “i’m wearing his gloves, because it’s freezing and i forgot to bring mine. they dwarf my hands, and nolan smiles at the sight.”“large hands wrapped around my queen” - no i will not be providing context“the purposeful way his large hands close around the chess pieces” - her search history rn: “10 different ways to tell your readers that a guy has big hands”2. he's tall, dark-haired and sarcastic, and he might as well be adam carson with a new name- oh wait... 3. yes, there is no smut, but anytime sex was mentioned it was just incredibly cringey and awkward - wait, scratch that, this entire book was cringey and awkward and made it feel a whole lot less of a ya4. that ending was so rushed and so stupid because she just summarised the most exhilarating part of the book IN A NEWS ARTICLE aka the most boring form of literature ever5. incredibly weird dialogue. there was a whole page and a half about her sister's farting. and if you don't believe me yet, screw you and read this“yes, mallory. unclench your butthole”“i haven’t used the c-word in three years”“rooks, amirite?”“when he swallows, his throat bobs, a strong, mesmerizing movement that i notice because . . . i’m going bananapants?” “oh, fuck. no no no. oh, fuckity fuck fuck”“do they have a manager I can pull a karen with?”how does anyone expect me to review this shit?my attempt at an actual review (spoiler: it's not good):so do i actually remember the plot? was there even a plot? no and no. but what i do remember is that these things were mentioned in the first 2 pages:“i am reliably informed that you’re a gen z sex symbol” first sentence btw“probably reading bill nye erotic fanfiction”“i am expecting to see zendaya. harry styles. billie eilish. the entirety of bts, crammed on the couch of whatever late-night show the youtube autoplay algorithm decided to feed me”“they went viral on tikTok”“chesstok”and i remember telling myself to dnf right there, but continuing to read because it is free of that cringe shit we call smut that is heavily featured in every AH book apart from this one (twas still cringey tho)now, you may ask ""why saffiyah, why do you continue to torture yourself with the shittiest books ever to be crafted by authors at 2 am with an empty head and no thoughts?""and to that i say, because why not? why not be a masochist reading the worst books ever written just to write an even crappier rant review in the hopes that someone might laugh at my pain? why not? give me one good reason as to why i shouldn't...i'm going to ignore that perfectly reasonable reasonsee i may have pulled out my hair, and i may have grown some grey hairs at my very ripe age of - wait i'm not telling you how old i am - whilst waiting in agony for the book to finally come to an incredibly unsatisfying end but that is okay“why?” you ask in tears because of my pain, “why is it okay for you to suffer through a literary atrocity just for us?”well to that, i could write a really deep, meaningful sounding paragraph along the lines of what was originally written here (which in hindsight gives me second hand embarrassment - hindsight is such a bitch) but tbh it's mainly because i find happiness in complaining because it is fun.and i know that 2 out of the current 922 friends that i have (when the hell did i get 922 friends?) will enjoy reading this review, and read this review in it's entirety (yes i might be underestimating your attention spans) and for that i will persevere through book hell.

  now lets laugh at what my thoughts were at the beginning of the book.

"360","60683957","I think Ali Hazelwood would like me to begin by reminding you the love interest in this book is quite hulking and fit. It’ll come up a lot. Like massive arms and massive hands, which is how you know he is packing a massive…rook to knight combo. That’s how chess works, right? I’m not really sure but that is what is so great about Check & Mate because even if you previously had no interest in chess this book is so charming and energetic about the game that you’ll have a great time no matter what. I am absolute dog shit at chess—my phone app has beaten me enough to accept this—but I am delighted that Hazelwood said “you know what should be sexy? CHESS!” Hazelwood has made a name for herself with a wildly successful series of spicy adult novels featuring young women navigating fields typically gatekept by men and finding romance and here she enters the realm of YA where 18 year old Mallory returns to the world of chess, rusty from a long hiatus inflicted by shame and keeping her family afloat. Now she must face-off against misogynistic expectations and chess world champion slash thirst trap icon Nolan “I swear I’m not an Adam Driver Insert” Sawyer. The “Kingkiller”. The man with the big, meaty, sexy hands (remember this). But also the man she embarrassed by defeating in her first match, making her the new, hot topic about Chess World. Hazelwood writes with bubbly wit and while the constant corporate branding name drops might make one wonder if this book is collecting ad revenue, it's a fresh and fun rom-com that deals with themes of teen parentification, friendship anxieties and being thrust into a judgemental spotlight where the personal life you can barely keep from falling apart is suddenly the topic of social media speculation. Check & Mate is as corny as it is horny but, honestly, it's also just a good time that knows its audience well.‘His movements, when he touches the pieces, are precise, economical, strong. I hate myself for noticing that.’Girl, trust me, we all noticed that. Anyways, I found the premise of this to be quite promising and it lives up to it. It’s almost interesting enough to uphold the reluctant rivals to lovers engine that drives the story. While most realistic-fiction YA tends towards a high school setting, it was refreshing to see this being set in chess tournaments and libraries (‘God bless libraries.’ Agreed). Part of the premise is that chess is now the Big Thing thanks to Tiktok and Sawyer, the bad boy of chess, for inspiring a lot of content around his looks and temper tantrums (Kylo Ren behavior…), which, sure, I could believe that happening in this post-The Queen’s Gambit-fame, social media influenced world. And the youth getting really into chess is a super cool idea, I’d love that to happen. It also helps raise the stakes in this book because chess matches are covered like they are the Super Bowl and the cash prize is enormous. And so are Sawyer’s arms. The financial opportunities are key to our gal Mal’s motivations, and shd has more or less vanished from her own life in order to raise her aggressively-tween sisters and care for her sick mother. Hazelwood presents the hardships of a parentified teen who feels cornered by her own life that has been bent towards constant service of others to the point that taking time for herself is guilt-inducing. But all of chess is cloaked in a sense of shame for her and she hadn’t played in years, though the reason behind this is something Hazelwood only teases until the big reveal late in the novel (though its so hinted at I doubt the reason will come as a surprise to anyone after the first 20 pages). Hazelwood captures being burnt out and frustrated well while also making detangling all her insecurities a coming-of-age narrative nestled into the overall plot. ‘There’s lots to consider. My feelings about chess, for one, which I cannot disentangle from my feelings for Dad. They are twisted, knotted together. There’s pain. Regret. Nostalgia. Guilt. Hate. Above all, there’s anger. So much anger inside me. Mountains of it, entire blasing landscapes without a single furyless corner in them.’The YA genre suits Hazelwood well, being able to turn on the firehose of emotions and make the more immature or quippy moments read as more age appropriate as it does in some of the adult novels Hazelwood often gets compared with. I enjoyed that the characters are older than most YA, being in that sort of anxiety-ridden purgatory between high school and “being an adult”. A great example of this is Mallory’s friendship with Easton and the interplay of Mallory feeling FOMO as Easton goes off to college while Easton worries she is being similarly phased out due to Mallory’s rising-star adventures. While Hazelwood is known for being pretty spicy she tones it back a lot here to suit a YA audience in ways that never feel like self-censorship. There’s still a lot of waistband grabbing (those big, manly hands…) and brief steamy moments though its mostly fade-to-black. Perhaps the lack of sex in the book also helped focus on ensuring the plot held up and was engaging. Truthfully, I couldn’t put this down.Still, I liked these characters—the dialog is fun and snarky without feeling like it needs to only be one-liners to the point of absurdity—and while Mal and Sawyer’s relationship sometimes seems to conveniently progress despite them really only talking about chess its all pretty cute. Sawyer’s character works well as an example of misconstrued perceptions on a person and behind the mystique he is actually quite a lovable person who treats Mallory well. He’s also possibly an Adam Driver-cast insert as both Driver and Star Wars get a call-out in text. This seems to be Hazelwood’s thing and The Love Hypothesis began as Star Wars Reylo fanfiction in a STEM field and minus Kylo Ren’s penchant for war crimes. Plus we have the whole Mallory as a sort of “chosen one” who defeats temper tantrum boy who has trained for years which isn’t NOT the plot of Force Awakens if you squint at it. Though Sawyer’s grandfather and his mental health issues come up, thankfully he wasn’t notable for having committed a genocide. Have I mentioned that this guy is hulking? ‘Most women in chess decide to skip these events and complete in women-only tournaments. I bet you’re wondering why.’While Sawyer is supportive and sweet, the rest of the chess world is a minefield of misogyny for Mallory to navigate. Journalists love to ask her ‘how does it feel to be a women in chess?’ and her first experience with Koch—essentially the villain of the book—is him asking if she beat Sawyer by dressing evocatively. Good on Hazelwood for addressing the extra pressures and judgment on a woman in male-coded fields while inspiring young women to embrace their hobbies and strengths and achieve in whatever they want to do. But also good on her for making Koch so fun to hate. I mean, this guy is basically some teenage Ben Shapiro character twiddling his evil mustache (okay Koch doesn’t have a mustache but you get the idea) and being insufferable to everyone. You’ll want to punch him. A few times.There are a lot of complaints online about the use of slang and pop culture references here, which is whatever. Does it seem like a sort of eye rolling technique to be “this is how teens talk right?”, sure. But I do want to start a conspiracy theory that books will have product inserts as the new form of tv commercials because Hazelwood name-checks so many corporate brands and highly-specific product names that it feels weird. It’s like when the kid is sleep-talking brands in White Noise and I kept joking that this book is generating ad revenue to keep the publishing industry rolling.After having read Colleen Hoover and Emily Henry this year, I figured I should complete the trifecta and read an Ali Hazelwood and I’m pretty glad I did. Overall, this was pretty fun. It moves at a quick pace (shocking for a story about chess games, I know) and has some pretty fun ups-and-downs while following a fairly formulaic romance plotline. Sure I could probably nitpick stuff about plot holes or whatever, but at the end of the day that seems beside the point to me. I’m judging this based on my rule I’ve just now invented called the A Knights Tale Rule: believability is beside the point when you came to laugh along to a story about Heath Ledger looking great on a horse. This is fun and cute and I had a pleasant time reading it. It also achieves its main goal: making chess seem sexy. So excuse me, I’m going to go get my ass kicked by my chess app again and pretend I’m Gary Kasparov playing against Deep Blue. 3.5/5 “Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”",3
"361","60683957","3.75 stars rounded up. If you know nothing about chess but enjoyed watching The Queen’s Gambit and want something far less tragic, you would probably like Check & Mate. Overall, I really enjoyed the storyline and setting of this book. Though, if you are familiar with the pattern followed in Ali Hazelwood’s other books, you can probably guess the “twist” that comes towards the end. The character dynamics among the MC’s family felt really interesting and made Mallory feel much more like a real person. It made me wish we had gotten more of the same with Sawyer’s found family outside of the interactions with Mallory so I could see him as more than an obscenely tall, love interest and chess machine.In case you are wondering if there is any variety in the character descriptions from her other books, I feel I should point out that Ms. Hazelwood remains consistent in her writing. Paraphrased examples: “His hands are massive” and “I couldn’t miss him because he stands a head everyone else in the room”I will likely continue to read her books because they’re fun, typically light reads, but I wish she would give us some diversity in her characters. Give us some variety to match the real world, please!

"364","60683957","not particularly good, not horrible. just average. middling, if you will. but you know what — i enjoyed it. the only other book i’ve read by ali hazelwood is the love hypothesis, which i liked but found especially forgettable. the characters were flat and didn’t have much personality, the ethics of the relationship were questionable, the smut was truly some of the worst i have ever read, etc. this one is far better for several reasons, but unfortunately, it still falls short.mallory greenleaf: i love her. she’s a three dimensional character with clearly defined interests, motives, fears, and desires, and she is incredibly easy to root for. selfless to the point of being self sacrificing, she puts her family above all else. she fits the classic older sister archetype who shoulders the weight of the world and assumes the family responsibilities because if she doesn’t, everything will fall apart. my heart ached for her throughout the entire book. i just wanted her to be a kid for a second. to enjoy her youth and pursue what she loved, even though it may not have been the most practical thing for someone in her situation. i loved her character development too. seeing her go from hesitant and fearful of playing chess again bc of the memories to embracing her love for it was so heartwarming 🥹 that being said, she was a bit dense at times and made some (very) questionable decisions. the whole third act breakup?? SO unnecessary. i was so frustrated with her bc how are you going to get mad about that?? it didn’t even make sense 😭😭nolan sawyer: this man. THIS man 😩😩😩 i love him. he was amazing. i don’t have much to say bc that’s all that needs to be said.the romance: so cute. so wholesome. so pure 🥹 i don’t know what it is about young adult romance that gets me — perhaps it’s because i never got to experience that kind of love and part of me is still a little bitter about it they’re young and naive and unsure of themselves but somehow still full of hope. this book reminded me why i love this genre so much and why i will continue to love it, even as i enter my twenties. the plot: i know very little about chess. did i have any idea what anyone was talking about? no. did i still enjoy it? you bet i did. i was thoroughly invested from the very first page to the last. the chess competitions were so fun to read about, and i loved seeing mallory do what she’s best at. the gen z references: no. cut them out. get an editor, preferably someone who understands that adding pop culture references in every sentence just makes for a tedious, infuriating read. it would have been so much better without them. ”i’m tiny and he’s huge 🥺”: we get it. she’s so small she’s practically nonexistent and he’s the biggest creature to ever roam the earth. this shit drove me insane — i was about to claw my eyeballs out and bang my head against a wall and set the book on fire. i’m done. i’m DONE.⠂⠄⠄⠂⠁⠁⠂⠄⠄⠂⠁⠁⠂⠄⠄⠂ ⠂⠄⠄⠂☆a man who doesn’t feel emasculated when a woman beats him at something and instead admires her for it and even falls in love with her?? where can i find one 😩😩 rtc! but go read maya’s stunning review <3i never know if these links work so i apologize if they don’t 😔⠂⠄⠄⠂⠁⠁⠂⠄⠄⠂⠁⠁⠂⠄⠄⠂ ⠂⠄⠄⠂☆putting my crs on hold for this it better deliver",3
"365","60683957","Check & Mate written by Ali Hazelwood was just the book I needed. This was such a light and fluffy YA novel with heart breaking moments, but it made me laugh so much, I had tears streaming down my face. Okay, y'all, don't come for me. I know many people didn't love this book, but I absolutely adored it for many reasons. I know absolutely NOTHING about chess, but that's okay because Check & Mate teaches you so much about the sport. I've heard from many people that Ali Hazelwood writes very cringe smutty scenes, but I had never read her books before this one, but let me tell you, this book had no smut. If i'm going to be honest, I went into this book completely blind, which I think made me love it even more. I couldn't stop laughing the entire time, the characters had the best banter, the Gen-Z references had me cackling so much. The gorgeous pink cover is so gorgeous and I just fell in love. For my first time reading a book written by Ali Hazelwood, I can finally say I had the best experience. I laughed so much my stomach hurt, I had tears streaming down my face from all the laughing. I truly loved this book so much, it was cute, fluffy, fun, hilarious, and just so good. For those of you that haven't read this book yet, do yourself a huge favor and pick it up immediately, I can't recommend it enough. GEN-Z REFERENCES*Snapchat*BTS*OnlyFans*Twitter*Tiktok*Taylor Swift*Billie Eilish*Ed Sheeran body pillow (WHAT?)*Candy Crush*This is just the basic list, but there's plenty more.Mallory Greenleaf is done with chess. The destruction of chess destroyed her family for the worst. During a tournament, Mallory caught her father kissing another woman, meanwhile he had a family of his own. Since then, Mallory's father has unexpectedly passed away. After the sport of chess led to the destruction of her family four year earlier, Mallory's focus is now on her mom, her sisters, paying the bills, and her dead end job as a car mechanic to keep the lights on. Mallory is the oldest of three daughters, she plays surrogate mother as her mother is sick and can't really move, let alone take care of her other two daughters. Mallory's sister, Sabrina, drove me insane. Sabrina was totally ungrateful and only cared about herself. As Mallory was working her butt of trying to make ends meet, all Sabrina cared about was getting her derby bills paid. I couldn't help but cheer and love Mallory, I just wanted to reach into my kindle and give her the biggest hug ever, with no words. Mallory's main focus is on her mom and sisters, but that is until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and wipes the board clean against Nolan Sawyer. Nolan is completely shocked that Mallory beat him, but he wants to keep playing her over and over again.Okay, how did Mallory and Nolan play a game for seven hours straight? The only thing I can do for seven hours is read and sleep. Nolan Sawyer is known as the ""Kingkiller"" of chess, currently the world champion and reigning bad boy of chess. Nolan is a tall, grumpy, and temperamental chess player on the outside, but on the inside he is a soft, sugary cinnamon roll. The only thing I had a issue with is that Ali Hazelwood would always talk about how tall Nolan was, like okay, I get it, Nolan is tall as fuck. Nolan was a sweetheart, he might be the bad boy of chess and the world champion, but he wanted to keep playing Mallory over and over to secretly help her become the best female chess player in the world. The things Nolan did for Mallory just warmed my heart so much. Cinnamon roll sweetheart, Nolan Sawyer, had my heart in a choke hold. I couldn't help but love Mallory and Nolan , they were just two precious souls. Nolan was very sarcastic and very blunt during press interviews, he was never afraid to speak what was on his mind. Despite Mallory being back in her chess world, she wants to keep her family out of it, but that's kind of hard when there's tabloids of Mallory and Nolan going around. Mallory and Nolan were just have a conversation, but people made the picture of them together go viral like Mallory and Nolan were dating.",5
"366","60683957","“When I’m with you, Mallory, everything is different. When I’m with you, I want to play more than I want to win.”
It feels like I've been deceived by Ali and this book. My first anticipated read of this month and this book definitely wasn't what I expected. I was so excited to read it because it is written by Ali and she said it's an angsty rivals to lovers story in chess world but it was more about chess tournaments and chess championships than Mallory and Nolan and their rivals to lovers romance. The plot had so much potential but the execution of it was a bit off and unsatisfactory. How can you expect me to read 350 pages about the never ending chess tournaments and how FIDE and all the things worked in chess world. There was just too much info dumping about it. I wanted more focus on character's development and romantic part of the story.
  “He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”
Ali seriously need to stop using Gen Z references like TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse in her books. I was so close to dnf this book because of these refrences. Honestly I never had any problem with Gen Z refrences in books but the way Ali tried to put these in almot every sentence and conversation between the characters made this book a bit cringe. My favourite things in this book were Nolan Sawyer, the romance part and Mallory's little sister Darcy. She was so adorably hilarious.
  “Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?” I feel him shrug. “Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”
The romance was cute and adorable. It was young love and even swoon-worthy but there wasn't much rivalry between Mallory and Nolan like the way Ali promoted it. There were some cute amd funny moments which I absolutely adored but I did not like the way Mallory treated him sometimes. The way Nolan cared for her and made sure she got the fellowship in chess was just so precious. He wanted to play chess with her and she denied him every single time and I understand her reasons but Nolan did everything he could to earn her trust. Nolan deserves so much better. Also I hated how he was more like a side character in this book than the ""actual"" side characters which is the worst that could happen to a mmc. 
  He turns us around and then we’re on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. “You’ll be playing the most beautiful chess I’ve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me. It’s fucking confusing.”

  ➸ Nolan Sawyer
Nolan the 20 year old number one world chess player, is a millionaire, the quiet and moody boy who is secretly a cinnamon roll for Mallory, was obsessed with Mallory because he lost a match to her and wanted her and did everything to have her, wanted to play a chess match with her and even begged her for a match because only she made him feel alive, spends time with Mallory's family and treats them like his own, knows how to complement and treats a woman. He is a perfect man. 
  “Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”

  ➸ Mallory Greenleaf
The oldest sibling in her family who had to take care of her two younger sisters and her mother so I'm sure you know what I'm trying to tell you about her here. She had family issues and mostly daddy issues and on top of that commitment issues and it took her years to finally talk about them with her family and stop hating herself for them. I didn't like her but I also feel like she never deserves any of the shit she went through for years.
  “He studies me for longer than is comfortable. Galaxies pass through his black eyes, and I wonder whether this second could last a century. Whether the universe could be just me and him, understanding each other on a forever loop.”
The ending was a ""typical Ali Hazelwood ending"" with a third act breakup over a misunderstanding which can be cleared by talking but as usual the Fmc is too tired, too betrayed to even listen what mmc have to say in his defense. But then she realises she made a mistake and goes back to the mmc. I already knew what was about to happen in the end. Overall this book was fine and even enjoyable sometimes. I liked how Ali tried to step out of her usual ""women in stem"" books and tried something different. You might love this more than me if you are able to ignore all the Gen Z refrences and all the never ending chess tournaments. 
  “Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”",3
"367","60683957","3.5/5Listen, was it perfect? No. Did this book have too many Gen Z references, including TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, and some people I don't want to hear about in my romance books, like Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse? Yes. Especially at the beginning, when I thought I would literally put this book down because of this. Didn't I particularly like the heroine? Also yes. But, did this book have Nolan Sawyer, the number one chess player in the world at only twenty years old, who was rich, the quiet and intimidating one who was obsessed with the heroine and was able to do anything for her. Yes. Nolan Sawyer, my new type and dream man? Yes, yes and yes.

    ""His full lips tremble for the barest second. “Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”

I just feel to my knees. Again.

    ""I roll my eyes. “No follow-up questions.” He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”

"368","60683957","i don’t like mallory, i don’t like her ungrateful sisters, i don’t like genz references which was obviously written by someone who never met a genz. i don’t like endless chess facts which is somehow boring than other scientific informations in her books. i don’t like how at least %40 of the book didn’t even involve nolan. i don’t like the ending because what kind of ending is that????? never been more unsatisfied with an ending🤚🏻i love nolan🩷💗😍💋 precious baby. you deserve 5 stars but i’m giving 2 for your little role in this romance. he was sweet, caring and honestly a really good boyfriend. i don’t want to discuss if mallory deserves him because it’s 3am and i spent unnecessary time reading this book. so that’s all. i’m just gonna leave three cute quotes from nolan for your suffering through this dumb review 😔 “Because when I’m with you, Mallory, everything is different.

  nolan
 ♟️At the start, I didn’t mind Nolan. I loved his cocky, world champion, I’m-better-than-you personality. BUT IT JUST DISAPPEARED. Like I wanted MORE of a rivalry or SOMETHING, but he was just fine??

"371","60683957","⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ ♟️ about my first impression ♟️ ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ before we dive into it, i think i need to be honest with all of you, my loves, unfortunately, i cannot be considered a reliable source in this review since my obsession with everything that ali hazelwood writes is all over the place (please don't cry, nor grieve for me) - even though, her books are not that good (yes, i’m talking about the random little novellas she has published recently - shrugs and sights deeply). like i was saying, although she's not the most creative and innovative person i’ve ever seen in my whole life, her books never fail to miss with me (i'm talking dead serious with you rn) bc they're always able to get me out of the ugliest and most disturbing reading slumps - and thank fck for that (cheers). and i don't really know what’s the secret ingredient to her stories, but they’re always so lighthearted, fluffy, cute and witty - the time flies by without you noticing stg. we know - from her extremely subtle hints - that she has a huge fetish (and I mean huuuuge) for giants (bigfoot style) and polly pocket dolls, but, i don't know, there are people out there who get off on feet photos, so you know, it could be worse, guys - but could also be better ngl. that being said, the moment i found out that she would be writing a book considered to be outside of her comfort zone (insert STEM universe here), i NEEDED to buy this work of art and read it immediately and viscerally cause i really wanted to know what she would come up with in a different trope and in a different universe, especially with characters that were younger than the ones she was used to write. and on top of that (!!) chess was involved? take my card and do what you want with it. however, i think everyone heard that ali decided to incorporate a dictionary of references that she thought were young, funny and cool (stop that, mom), invoking timothee chalamet's name more times than the main character's ginormous hands around that small tiny coffee mug. i kept thinking to myself that this would shred my reading to pieces, but you kind of get used to it (exposure therapy maybe? idk) and the story becomes engaging enough to make you forget that nolan is considered the sexiest boy of our generation and that there are several edits of him on tiktok - and it’s probably playing end game by taylor swift as a background audio.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀 about the characters 🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ mallory greenleaf. our main character. our chess prodigy that no longer plays. our child playing the mother role for her bratty sisters. our daughter with daddy issues and, therefore, commitment issues (go get that therapy, pet). mal is sweet, smart, funny, kind, hardworking and extremely down to earth - in another words, it’s a very hard and difficult task not to adore her and cheer for her throughout the book - which sometimes makes you want to smack her head on the table so hard that she would maybe stop being so dense and selfless - PLEASE for once in your life be a spoiled, bitchy and ego centrical teenage girl that only thinks of herself (breathes in and out to calm herself down). once you get through that, her unconditional love for her family is, indeed, really admirable and cute, the things she gave up for them and the shitty jobs she took for them, all of her sacrifices will make your heart ache and break a little. and that’s the reason why we love to see her finding herself once again in chess - this is not a spoiler because it is painfully obvious that she will play again eventually - like it’s a chess book, someone has to play at some point, right? and about that, don’t be afraid of not understanding shit, ali actually makes a great job in this part - as she did with stem terms in her previous books. nolan sawyer. our second main character. our timothee chalamet goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, adam driver, you were bigger than the whole sky of chess. our supposedly moody and bad tempered privileged boy that is secretly (but not so secretly) mal’s great admirer (god bless his tormented soul). nolan is unapologetic himself, confident, smart, sarcastic, a bit closed off but, nonetheless, a great friend to his loved ones- and did i mention that he’s the tallest man ever with this huge hands? cause he is - just so you know. this poor boy has had it enough, he’s tired, he’s bored, he’s almost entering an existencial mid life crisis in his teenage years - like can you imagine being so intelligent and gifted that playing chess with other grandmasters (they’re like the cool and talented kids of chess) put’s you into a sleeping coma since their moves are so predictable to you. enters mallory. who manages to wipe the floor with him (her words, not mine) during a match. the boy is whipped and he knows it. - she rizzed him up with a checkmate, who knows.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ ♟️ about the romance ♟️ ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ it’s cute. it’s sweet. it’s swoon worthy. it’s young love. it’s legs being kicked. it’s giggles being smothered. it’s cheeks being painted crimson and scarlet red. and it’s PG 13 - don’t you go crying and booing in my doorstep, now, please, because their interactions and affectionate moments and late night conversations and “can’t keep my hands/eyes to myself” are, indeed very lovable and heartwarming and - color me surprised - enough to make you love love love the romance. do we have a third act breakup? do we have a fall out? and does it happens in the last few pages? does she run away? can’t tell you that since, duh, spoilers, but what i’ll say is that whatever happened in the end didn’t bother me and it was actually necessary for mal’s growth - so there you have it, my little spoiler munchkin. ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀 about my final thoughts  🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ as you know, it was a four stars rating for me (clap your hands and make noise) since i truly loved and enjoyed it every second of it (there were some moments though that his hands wer- never mind i got distracted) and devoured the book like i haven’t been fed in ages - almost like a small victorian child going through the bubonic plague in the mid 1300s, but it was just me in a reading slump. but, maya, the references were so annoying and uncalled for - someone whined in the crowd (plot twist: it was me whining), now, don’t you worry my child, like i said in the beginning, you really get used to it and start to brush it off eventually, promise you (and cross my heart). and i think it’s pretty obvious that i’ll be recommending this gorgeous book to my lovely gals out here, but just for the ones that tend to enjoy this cutesy type of book, the ones that love wes bennett you know - if you  only like dark romance, this shit is not for you, bub, however, if you go both ways, then you should definitely give it a shot, it’s no ”i’m-going-to-make-your-life-miserable-and-spit-on-you-and-humillate-you-but-you-must-know-that-i-love-you-secretly” (which i vouch for, as a matter of fact, and am very into it also - will always love you darius) but more of a “i-know-that-i’m-staring-at-you-like-i-hate-you-but-in-reality-i-love-everything-you-do” kind of thing.no and who tf is the girl with the “i heart rome” shirt talking to mal in the end?

"372","60683957","an incomplete list of all the pop culture referances in Check & Matezendaya, harry styles, billie eilish, BTS, youtube, latenight shows, james corden/jimmy kimmel, tiktok, chess.com, riverdale (what feels like thousands of times), lara jean, all the boys ive loved before, fanfiction, AO3, tumblr, percy jackson, jungkook, taylor swift, ari aster, hobbits, meghan markle, and many more i am sure i did not notice. while i dont hugely mind pop culture referance it definitely dates your book, when all these things are no longer relevent people most likely will not read this book because of that fact, therefore it is always wise to leave out pop culture referances so it will be timeless. the relationship itself was cute, but it also felt so rushed imo, i dont know if that because i read it quite fast or not but to me I felt that the characters could have been fleshed out a little bit more before they started to have their wee romance. I did like both characters, Sawyer was adorbale and the he falls first & harder trope is always good and I love where the character at the top of his field gets challenged by someone. However I feel like i didn't reallyknow them, but got illuded to trauma both had. sadly, i wish i enjoyed this more, the more i think about it the more i dislike it so im going to stop here. i'll keep my happy memories. ali ill be back for the next one 🫡previous review anyways here is my message to Ali Hazelwood on book ideas she could use while still staying in the relm of science.number one: two reaserches that are  best friends (shocker right they are not eniemes that have a missunderstanding) are reaserching nuclear fusion lets say (because we just had a big advancement in that how exciting 😍) okay and get this the two friends both have feelings for each other but hide it to protect there friendship and through there reaserch they are around each other more and so it becomes harder to repress there feelings and suddenly one of them lets slip and they get together, all slowburn so no need for misscommuniaction or anything, you have smut, science, AND slowburn. throw that alliteration in too and your english teacher will be as happy as a clam. numer two: instead of enemies lets have academic rivals, the begruding respect but wanting to be better the tension😍 oh its so perfect, and lets say they are in collage/university (whatever you call it) and lets have them be in a really hard degree like mathematics or enginering or biochemistry. And they both have academic validation so they NEED to get top scores and be at the top of the class and its one or the other one week is him then its her ugh iconic. THEN they get paired up together for an assessment that is like half there grade and its SUPER important and so they have to work together on a engineering project/mathmatical problem/ biochemistry reaserch paper. and slowly they get to know eachother more than just this person i need to beat and they fall in love, and while in that relationship they still have that respectful rivaly and banter we all lovenumber three: something like the love on the brain where they are in a company building setting where a bunch of different academics are creating something amazing and groubdbreaking in science, the two main characters are two completly different people, one a biologist that looks at the evolution of animals and why creatures adapted due to enviromental changes. and a mechanical engineer, the biologist (lets make him a man because hey! lets break these gender norms) and hes there to help with something idk yet this is an idea not a story dont judge me im a humble reviewer, and the womans the mechanical engineer thats there to bring the entire thing to life. they are opposites in everyway, hes all nature and the evolution of life and shes the numbers, but it works somehow they get close and together. i dont know not my best idea but i like the number three so we are running with it. why not add in more than science? sprinkle some computor coders, they deserve a love story because coding is hard, add some teachnology, people discovering ai, mathematics is always fun (said no one but me ever) that would always be so fun to look at.and while your at it add in some queer rep made two women in stem fall in love, now that would be iconic. 💅oh and in all of them please no galexy leggins, unicorn socks or cat hoodies please our main character is meant to be smart and sophisticated not a crazy millenial cat lady she has more important things to be doing like discovering so many new things. 💪💪as a women in science i love what you are doing, but honestly, i think you have the ability, skill and popularity to go above and beyond with your message.",3

 I haven't been to a library in so long because the closest one is so far, and it makes me so sad because I love them 😭Anyways, this is my second Ali Hazelwood book, the first being The Love Hypothesis, which I adored. I really want to read Love, Theoretically, but I haven't gotten around to it, but I will someday. I am honestly pretty disappointed in this, since I've been expecting this book since it first was announced, and since the cover was first revealed, and I was so excited! But alas｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟPlotI'm usually pretty good at reading contemporaries or romances because the plot is super easy to follow, and that's exactly what this was.Except for all that chess lingo. I haven't played chess a day in my life, and I never intend to after learning what I have in this book. The game can go on for over six hours?? That's not happening, I think I'll stick to my little checkers board thank you very much.Anyways, back to the plot, I thought it was nice and simple, and great for a quick read.Now, my complaint is the fact that sometimes, authors write YA as if it's a middle grade novel. This book borders on the edge of YA and New adult or adult, because while it's advertised as YA, and the main character is 18, some of the jokes and scenes weren't very YA-ish. The only thing that stopped it from being new adult was the fade to black scene. I don't really care, because I can't lie, I was disappointed when I found out this book was YA. It probably would've been better if it was adult, because some of those stupid childish jokes would've been cut out. I don't know why people think that YA is geared towards more childish jokes, YA is not only being read by children.Here are some examples! I'm sorry.“This morning my roommate repeatedly farted on my pillow because I dared to ask her not to practice her xylophone at 5:30 am.”this one legitimately made me close my eyes, close my book, and take a deep, long breath. Fart jokes became old in elementary school, and even then, I despised them.“Unclench your butthole, Mallory.”shut up“When he swallows, his throat bobs, a strong, mesmerizing movement that I notice because . . . I’m going bananapants?”actually shut upwelcome back to elementary school kids! I hope you have a FABULOUS VISITthere were too many fart jokes to count in one scene, and it made me want to walk all the way to the lake outside my house and chuck the book into it.and want to see one of the first sentences in the book?“Mrs. Agarwal is at her desk, pretending to grade papers but probably reading Bill Nye erotic fanfiction.”well then !I will admit....some scenes made me laugh. The book did get better as it progressed, which is the reason it has 3 stars instead of 2 ☺Oh, and I know Ali Hazelwood gets talked about for always making her male characters huge and her female characters tiny, so I tallied out how many times Nolan was described in any way as ""big"" or big compared to the main character, and I have concluded that it was around 13. Take that information and do what you will.Also, there were so many pop culture references in this that it was crazy. TikTok was mentioned a few times, and I didn't really care, which was surprising, but it got annoying to an extent, and then Taylor Swift was mentioned, but of course I didn't mind that, have you seen the Taylor's Version in my name? There were a lot of other bands and modern stuff, and this is why I stick to fantasy, where none of this is ever mentioned 😌 (I will admit, I liked the talk about Timothée Chalamet, only because I had his statistics song stuck in my head.)do not get me started on the Percy Jackson reference, I'm trying to wipe it from my memory please and THANK YOU. I don't remember it all, but there's some about reading erotic Percy Jackson fanfics and having him and someone sixty-nine. I'm not ok at the moment, save Percy.I don't remember who he's doing that with, I'd rather not know anyways“because when I asked myself if I had the right to those tears, the answer was always no, and it was easy to stop myself.”shut the hell upSorry if I run out of quotes halfway through the review, there's like none in the quotes section and I don't want to go back into the book.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe CharactersI hated Mallory so much in the beginning of the book. She was getting on my nerves with her stupid attitude. I get that she was going through a lot, and I understand that, but she was so negative that even I, the queen of negativity, was flabbergasted. She believed the worst of everyone and everything, and it happened so often that I wanted to scream. Thankfully, she got better, like way better, and the end of the book. We love a good character development.Now Nolan's situation is complicated for me, because I'd easily fall in love with him, BUT, that is also the name of a close family member to me 😃 so let me tell you, my inner conflict was going crazy during certain parts of the story, because I loved him as a character, I love the tall, dark, and handsomes, especially when they're mysterious and cold, but I just couldn't get past that his name was someone I was related to! For this reason, he will not be added to my list of book boyfriends.I really liked the side characters, and Oz was the best character hands down. When he told Mallory off, I was grinning so hard because he was just saying facts and putting that girl in her place, and it was so satisfying.SABRINA WAS A BITCH THOUGH. I don't care if she's fourteen years old and some fourteen year olds are bitches, but she was so rude, I couldn't stand it. “I think about a deserted chessboard. Only the white king on it, standing on the home square. Alone, untethered, safe from threats. Free to roam.”｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe RomanceI will admit, I did find the romance quite cute. A tad unrealistic, a tad fast, but it'd make me boring if I nit-picked based on just those two things, so I'll let it slide. The tension between them was pretty well created, and some of their scenes actually made me giggle, which is the best thing ever in a romance book.Of course, this book also came with the good ol' second act drama. I think it was kind of a miscommunication, but Mallory also really overreacted, because based on her need for money at the time, I don't see why she would've gotten upset, or maybe I'm just not that kind of person 😭I'm also quite annoyed at the fact that we didn't get a solid reunion at the end. I had to read a ""two years later"" epilogue written in NEWSPAPER FORM. I DON'T CARE I WANT TO SEE THEM INTERACTING AS AN ACTUAL COUPLE.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟoverall, unless you love YA that's on the way way upper side of YA but also has a ton of elementary school jokes that will make you want to throw the book into a lake and has a main character that you want to throw in the lake with said book, I'd recommend skipping on this one.save yourselfthis review made me angry, so I'm deducting my rating to 2.5 stars2.5 starsInstead of putting a quote, I will be putting all of the pop culture references I found while flipping through again! I definitely missed some, but trust me, there's a lot. Enjoy because I certainly didn't: Bill Nye erotic fanfic, Zendaya, Harry Styles (x2), Billie Eilish, BTS (x2), TikTok (x14), ChessTok, (all of this was in the PROLOGUE y'all), Dragon Age (mentioned numerous times), Paris Hilton, Timothée Chalamet (x3), VSCO, the Avengers, Michelle Obama, Malala (x2), tentacle porn (um), Veronica Mars (x2), Candy Crush (x5), Jane Goodall, something about having a foursome with a sapoisexual furry, Thanos and Tony Stark, The Hunger Games, Spider-Man, Fast & Furious, the Jennifer Lawrence Oscars mishap, Lilo & Stitch, Krispy Kreme, the Powerball, Homeland Security, Riverdale (multiple times), details about Riverdale, Cole Sprouse, Lara Jean (referring To All the Boys I've Loved Before), Jeff Bezos (x2), AO3, Snapchat, Tinder, Tom Hanks, Justin Bieber, Michael Phelps, Goodreads (wow), Vanity Fair (multiple), Mother Theresa, IHOP (a few times), Etsy, Suavage by Christian Dior, Discord, Corpse Bride (x2), Doom Patrol, Jungkook, Piggie-Tinder, Photoshop, Bill Gates, an Adam Driver meme (how funny), PS5, ASMR, Taylor Swift (x2), Meghan Markle, Percy JacksonI think I just blacked out.<><><><><><>alright, i guess i need to read another book to make sure i don't end the year with a mediocre rating. i've been talking a lot of crap on this book, but i will say, despite everything i've said, i liked mallory's character development.though i will also say, this book does not deserve to be the winner of the awards this yearrtc<><><><><><>pre-read: oh my gosh COVER! it's actually so cute, I love the background colors",3

"375","60683957","—♟ 4.5 stars ♟—“Because when I’m with you, Mallory, everything is different. When I’m with you, I want to play more than I want to win.”————about the book————Age: YAGenres: Contemporary Romance Writing: 8/10 Quotes: 8/10World building: n/aCharacters: 9/10Romance: 9/10My rating: 9/10 trigger warnings: Cheating (Parent), Death of a Father, Car Accident, Death of a Grandfather, etc.———my thoughts———Ali Hazelwood’s writing, books and characters aren’t for everyone.But I love them.As her first YA release (also her first non-STEM release), I was initially a little worried and curious to see how she’d adapt her writing and characters.Honestly? I think she did it well.Yes, there’s innumerable references to everything popular right now, but I don’t think anything actually made me cringe.The chess part of the plot (as someone who knows less than nothing about chess) was interesting. I may not have understood all the terminology (what IS the Grünfeld) but I got the gist of it.The actual plot itself felt very cozy to me. Not a lot happened, there were more thoughts and feelings than anything else, and it was just really sweet.Ali’s books always tend to be quick reads, but I almost didn’t want to put this down, and if I haven’t had things to do...I definitely would have finished it in just a few hours.The characters were quite easily my favourite part, even though I did want to slap a particular sister once or twice.Mallory, the protagonist, felt very relatable to me. Maybe it’s because we’re both the oldest sister, maybe it’s because she (like me) has the unfortunate habit of trying to do everything herself, but all I know is that I really enjoyed her perspective.The only thing that could have made this book better is Nolan having a POV. Tall, sarcastic men who don’t know how to function in society are always my favourites, so it’s no surprise I loved him. Emil and Tanu were good side characters, and (if a little annoying at times) quite sweet.And Oz? I lost count of the times he made me laugh, with his threats and general grouchiness. All together, they’re the cast for a book I can only describe as adorable.————quotes————“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?”“Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”“He told me once that sometimes, with some people, it's not about winning or losing, That with some people, it's just about playing. Though for the longest time, I didn't really believe him.” “He’s tireless, unshakable. Driven in an indomitable, near- obsessive way. This iron- hard tenacity of his is an oddly attractive quality.” “I feel protected from attacks from all sides. Like the king during good chess.”“Even the good ones, they don’t know how it feels. They don’t know what it’s like, being told that you’re inherently destined to be second best.”“I resign. You win. Can I kiss you?”“I fall asleep mid game—for the second time in my life held by someone, for the second time in my life held by Nolan Sawyer.”“I’m going to fall over. Or I’ll be fine, here in his lap.”———random extra thoughts———I literally keep staring at the cover 😭 it’s so pink and cuteThanks for reading! ❤️",4

"377","181344829","update: 4/27/24people are so funny. they preach about respecting people’s opinions and that everyone is entitled to it but contradict themselves and get hurt the moment they see someone rating a book 1-star and writing “a whole essay” on why they didn't like it. you poor thing, hurt over a stranger’s opinion over a book. on a book reviewing site. where we can all share our own thoughts. what has 2024 come to, right? i’ve decided to turn off comments and not let non-friends comment on reviews, as well as go private, cause people can’t understand that this is a public book reviewing site where we are all entitled to say what we want about a book we didn’t like. i’d like to remind everyone that this is my third ali hazelwood book and i read it because it was a paranormal romance, not a contemporary stem romance like the rest. y’all like to read but clearly didn’t read where i stated this.also, if you guys think this review is a whole essay, don't look at my full, coherent reviews. ALSO, if i wanna write an essay, you bet i will. i didn’t know there were rules to how we choose to write reviews! 🫣telling me to grow up but y’all are mad i didn't like your 2010 wattpad vampyre romance over a character named misery. y’all are miserable just like her name. commenting on reviews because you’re mad. 😂 you guys care way too much how strangers spend their own time, it's concerning.in reply to most comments i get: “get a job” i do, and it pays well. it pays more than enough for myself, for my bills, and for my food. “get a life” says the one commenting on a review they disagree with.“why spend your time reading her books” because i can. thanks for caring about how i chose to spend my own time. “did you need to write a whole essay?” did they never teach you in class how to write essays? these are bullet points. there’s a difference. but if i wanna write an ‘essay’ over a book i didn’t like, i will. maybe teach yourself what the words opinion and decision means.“it’s not that serious” so why are you mad?“you’re boring” good thing we aren’t friends.----------------------------------------if ali hazelwood has 1000 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 100 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 50 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 1 hater, i’m me. if ali hazelwood has no haters, it means i am dead. if the world is with ali hazelwood, then i am against the world.other actual thought because i did actually read this…this: • enemies to lovers WHERE? it is never to be seen. not even an ounce of it. • do authors not get second hand embarrassment giving their characters terrible names like misery and lowe??• vampYres instead of vampires is the cherry on top• that cover is giving 2013 wattpad era • i felt no chemistry between the characters. it’s too bad because their friendship and slow burn had potential. • of course he growls, hisses and has a very husky voice• don’t forget he’s So Big. his shoe size is 14, because that is very important and necessary information. his hand is also so big it engulfs her own. he towers over her because He’s Huge. DO NOT FORGET!• obviously he never actually Hated Her, he just had to kinda pretend. she just thinks he does because he can’t stand the smell of her. kinda like when edward was near bella that first time and she thought she reeked? yeah, like that. so she carried this misconception about what he thinks about her but OBVIOUSLY he just, has always liked her. he has been secretly obsessed with her, because when are they not secretly obsessed but pretend they are not? never. • OF COURSE he’s broody and grumpy and can be mean in the outside but is actually a Big Softie deep down inside. DUH! • misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child. • this was only my third read from this author. i’ve read The Love Hypothesis and Love on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the future unless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together. • formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.• if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t. a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!",1
"378","181344829","3.75/5I didn't expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that's exactly what I got, so I'm satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that's what happens when you grow up with Wattpad. Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me. But, let’s move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.one If you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple. ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ two I really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices — the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won't be added to my 'favorite heroines' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn't bad. three The hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I'm talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn't be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don't care.
  
    “I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”
  
four The romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn't want to admit it, and a heroine who can't pick up any hint about it even though it's quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don't, but it was kind of hot.five The plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won't complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn't work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr. ————————Vampires and werewolfs? I just know this man will be barking, growling and purring at her",4
"379","181344829","That was surprisingly entertaining and actually good. I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance. She did not ruin werewolves and vampires for me after all 😌This change of writing and direction was majorly needed and it worked brilliantly. But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷‍♀️ ✔️ Vampires + werewolves✔️ Marriage of convenience✔️ Slow burnThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance.  The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.  Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure. The characters are fun.  Misery and Lowe  are truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.  The side characters-  Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!  The romance  was pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭On a serious note,  one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline.  It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?! That deducted a star from me. Overall, it's pretty fun and worth trying. I adored the subtle Twilight references 🥰~•~•~Ali, bestie.. you better not ruin werewolves or vampires for me or am out for revenge 😀😀😀",4
"380","181344829","the only dawg in this book was me reading it…why did i lose myself control when he would be protective over her? why did i tear my pillow in half when he ‘marked’ her with his scent? why was i hollowing at the moon when they tied the knot?! 🤭in classic ali hazelwood fashion im served with a quirky female protagonist and a overlay muscled man with obsessive tendencies. and i am 100% here for it. i’ll always eat it up and bite my nails down to the quick reading her books. the way that Lowe got me wanting to walk the house in a sweet robe and a cigar….i love this werewolf!! from the cute ass relationship with his little sister to the way he leads his pack to going feral over Misery!!! i feel his masculine energy real bad. it totally fundamentally changed me as a person when she fed on him. i can’t lie, that was poetic and i let out an animalistic moan. these bitches are feral for one another and it’s everything for me.",4

"389","181344829","13 reasons why you should not waste your time reading this book:1. a wannabe mystery thriller with poor execution2. highly underwhelming3. incredibly boring4. with a bland MMC (i don't hate him, but he didn't faze me much)5. with good characters but trash world building (srsly misery was funny as fuck. she, along with ana, alex, and the other weres were the only redeeming points of this book)6. lame romance7. zero chemistry8. unseasoned smut (not him chanting my mate, my mate, my mate during smut at the last chapter💀 also-- 
  ""My beautiful mate, coming all over my knot.""
-- yeah absolutely tf not💀🤚9. the cover (and the storyline) is giving wattpad10. un-digestable writing. the plot twist chapter gave me such a major headache. misery's bitchass of a father took pages to explain shit. LIKE DUDE JUST COME TO THE FUCKING POINT, YOU AIN'T NO POET!!11. the romance doesn't actually start until 40% of the book and it still isn't the main focus of the book (although it did try to be)12. third act breakup. same old silly reason as to why the mmc can't be with the fmc despite knowing that she's his mate.

HARDLY ANY MEMORABLE SWOON WORTHY MOMENTS.a shame that this had to be my first ali hazelwood book. either that, or she's not my cuppa tea, knowing how some people are claiming this to be her best work.>> what i really really liked is the characters. all of them were so awesome. misery was a great fmc. she had that humour, boldness, courage and she knew how to fucking communicate (unlike lowe🙄). alex was such a cute nerd and ana is the loml. i love that cute little shit. hell i even like mike. and serena!! and koen!! there's something about the found family trope that i eat up EVERY.

"390","181344829","This was everything that I wanted in a paranormal romance!!!To no one’s surprise, I loved this book! I'm an Ali Hazelwood stan, so my hopes for her very first PNR were extremely high, and I’m so happy that it lived up to all my expectations. This is a marriage of convenience between a vampire heroine and an alpha werewolf hero. Misery is the daughter of a powerful vampire politician and she enters a MOC with Lowe, the alpha of a werewolf pack, not just to form an alliance between the two species (who don’t like each other), but also to find out where her missing best friend is.It’s such a fun read and I loved learning about this paranormal world. The romance is classic Ali Hazelwood, just with a PNR twist. Basically, we have a hero who’s secretly pining and growing obsessed with the heroine, and she has no idea. It’s a little slow burn, but there’s still some GOOD steam. It’s focused just more in the second half of the book. But I loved Lowe and Misery, and I LOVED Misery's sense of humor. The girl is freaking hilarious.I’m dying for Ali to write more PNRs now. Like the ending of this book?? You can't tell me that's not a lead up to more of this world. Either way, it truly feels like Ali Hazelwood was MEANT to write PNR and I'm praying for her next one!*****THIS IS NOT A DRILL ALI HAZELWOOD IS WRITING A VAMPIRE + WEREWOLF ROMANCE OMFG. WITH A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE.",5
"391","181344829","vampire and werewolf blurb aside ... what in the wattpad is this cover i'm crying 😭I hated the cover at the beginning, but it's slowly growing on me 🫡 Misery, Lowe and Ana have my heart!! Didn't expect to love this as much as I did, but Ali Hazelwood did it again 🐺",4
"392","181344829","I understand the Ali Hazelwood hype now. This book had me by a chokehold, I finished reading it and immediately started over from the beginning and read it again",5
"393","181344829","Hell yeah! Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock 'n' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clichés. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we're in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There's so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe's family line and Misery's inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I'm thrilled to say she didn't disappoint.Here's a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she's become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that's another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe's little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He's loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone's needs first. He's the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I'm not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4
"394","181344829","what started off as promising went downhill quick.╰┈➤ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars 😄╰┈➤ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars 🙂╰┈➤ the book including the knot spice: 2 stars 🥴╰┈➤ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail. the spice was knot it. it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it was how the scenes were written. i am slightly? traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i’m not alone in my misery. speaking of Misery... … really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?  i hope i never have to think of The Home Depot’s Lowe’s strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. 👋🏻😌",2
"395","181344829","This is knot not your typical Ali Hazelwood but  if you are looking for a furr-ociously good time…no, no, that's too corny… mount up and…wait, too suggestive… sink your teeth into…ah hell… Okay so Bride by Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here. There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecies erotica pairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books like The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet to brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screaming just fucking tell me already (take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIG Underworld film vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’s Fledgling more than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it. It’s left pretty open for a sequel, I’ll look forward to finding out from your reviews because I think one was more than enough for me.2.5/5",2

"401","181344829","Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTokI was so curious about BRIDE ever since I heard that Hazelwood was breaking from her usual female-lab-scientist-in-love formula to do a PNR. And it was going to be Omegaverse lite??? With knotting? Yeah, there was no way I was knot going to read that. But this book was so hard to get a copy of. For a while, there were no used copies available and everywhere was sold out. It was popular AF. I was intrigued AF.Now that I've finally read it, I can see why. It still has the rom-com vibes of Hazelwood's other books, but she takes a breather on the ""oh my god, I'm so smol"" descriptions that her heroines usually have. Misery, the vampire heroine, is still a STEM heroine-- she's a computer hacker who has been living amongst the humans for years-- but she's a lot more likable and interesting than some of Hazelwood's other heroines, and oh my god, I loved the dry humor and medical jargon. This is definitely a more scientific take on vamps.I also loved Lowe, the hero. He was so charming and hot and nice, and kind of reminded me a little of Curran, from the Kate Daniels series. Actually, BRIDE as a whole very much has a sort of aughts paranormal throwback vibe to it, and reading it made me very nostalgic for some of the urban fantasy romances that I read back when I was in college. I'm sure that's part of the reason why other people love it, too. Even though there's not a ton of plot, it's a fun journey and there's some fantastic twists. Especially if you love her take on fake dating/misunderstanding tropes.And I heard she's writing a sequel? Thank GOD.4 stars",4

"403","211835409","Bella had one mission with this book: give me an MMC to take over Ares Wilder's top spot. And besties, she did. I felt like I was cheating on Ares the whole time I read this book but I can't deny that Bella delivered with Callen Sinclair. Callen Sinclair is pure perfection and you are going to fall in love with him! Oh and this book, if I could give it infinite stars I would! It is just that good!If there is one thing you should know about me is that I love everything that Bella Matthews writes but Redeeming may be my favorite book to date! And we can thank that to Callen freaking Sinclair! So Callen Sinclair is the star football player and his heroine, Caitlin, is his best friends little sister and mafia princess who is most definitely off limits. And she has been for years until Callen can no longer fight it. So what happens when you get your best friends little sister pregnant? Looks like you will have read Redeeming to find out!For those of you who are familiar with the Bella-verse then Caitlin and Callen are not strangers. You know Callen as the playboy football player who always has a new girl on his arm and you would never expect him to settle down. And Caitlin is seen as loud and annoying to the boys. She's never really been included, thanks to her big brother Maddox. But you see a very different side of both of them in this book. And to find out that these two has a history and have been pining for each other for years was something I didn't see coming. What I didn't expect? Callen to be such a protective hero. We all know Caitlin's dad is the big ole bad mafia boss Sam Beneventi. He's scary. But you know who wasn't scared? Callen. Our boy had no problem going toe to toe with Sam for his girl. In fact he had no problem telling anyone his true feelings and intentions with Caitlin. She came first and we love to see that in a hero.I'm honestly just at a loss for words. Every book that I read from Bella just keeps getting better and better. I just love everything that she writes. Her books are such comfort reads for me. I know when I pick up one of her books it's going to be a 5 star banger. In fact, her books feel like coming home. I feel like I am one with with world and I can never get enough. So Bella, thank you for taking the challenge to give me an MMC that tops Ares. You have succeeded. So now you need to top Callen ;) Have fun!!!!You should most definitely read this book if you like:- Football Romance- Surprise Pregnancy- Brother's Best Friend- Golden Retriever x Black Cat- Forbidden- Touch Her and Die* I would like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to Bella Matthews for continuing to give me the opportunity to read her books as an ARC.

Yes, please!Caitlin is fierce and knows what she wants, while Callen is this protective, swoon-worthy football player who just melts my heart. Watching them figure things out and seeing their emotional growth was everything. And can we talk about the meddling friends and family? It made the story feel so real and had me laughing (and tearing up!) along the way.If you’re into steamy, heartfelt romances with all the feels, this one is a must-read.

"406","211835409","3.5 ⭐️ | 3 🌶️This is my first time reading a Bella Matthew's book but this book made me feel like I needed to of read every single other one and not in the best way. Personally I thought this book was okay. It wasn't bad and the writing was good but this book was far to short for the plot, I felt no connection between both MCs at all, this was so family oriented every chapter included 5 different side characters and their kids. It felt like plots for the next books were being planted when I needed more from the main characters.This has 3 different parts and I'm not sure why, they come together, break up. Boom she's pregnant and then he's grovelling but not really and she's just constantly arguing with everyone. There was no emotional depth or connection.Everything happens so fast there's an underlying drama but it never hits home, the pregnancy felt non existent until she gave birth and that was right at the end. This is a good read for someone that doesn't care for depth or lots of romance. Definitely feel like you need to read every book about the side characters to gain the feel of it all and actually remember who is who and what kids are who's and who the main characters are actually related too.",3
"407","211835409","A rough start for me, but finished strong If you have not read any of the Kroydon Hills books, l urge you to do so. This is a second generation, and this is a heavily family centered series, so there are many family members from the previous books. Loads. You’ll be fine if you haven’t read them and can accept that there are tons of family members with stories you haven’t read. Their stories are not pivotal to this story’s plot, but they are definitely involved. As a general rule- I adore this world, this crazy family, the hilarious group texts, the relationships that are closer than siblings even across generations. Everyone has everyone's back, even if they bicker like siblings at times. But this book was a struggle for me initially. That hurts to admit. This time we have Caitlin Beneventi who is 24 years old and Callen Sinclair who is 28 years old. They’re both children of Kroyden Hills OG’s. Caitlin and Callen have always known each other. If you’ve read the other books, you know their families are hopelessly intertwined. He’s best friend with her older brother Maddox, and she always tried tagging along wanting to be allowed to hang out with them but always being denied by her brother Maddox. She’s been “crushing” on him since she was 6 years old - though I hate when that is even mentioned because let’s be real, that was puppy love. Which led to my first issue. I didn’t actually buy their chemistry. Not for a long time. Her side felt very immature crush-like. When she was 18y she snuck in to his room naked and tried to seduce him. Only he rejected her and she was mortified. It changed the course of their relationship, and they’ve been pretty avoidant or antagonistic ever since. My issue here- he was in a LTR at the time with a girlfriend he’d been with for four years. That makes it super ick for her to try to make him cheat and try to take him from someone else. NGL I almost quit reading. That made me really not like her as a person. Oddly, the girlfriend is never mentioned again. She was only brought up when they had a conversation about “that night” and he explained why he rejected her: She was “barely 18”, Maddox had made him swear to stay away from his sister, and he had a serious girlfriend.  ""You were eighteen, Caitlin. Barely eighteen. And I had a girlfriend. One I'd been with for four years.""“…I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a cheat. And I'm not a shit friend."" No idea when/how they broke up. At some point they must have, and he gets drafted into the NFL and naturally becomes your stereotypical manwhore. 🙄One thing I always hate- when the fmc is pining endlessly over the mmc. He is almost always a manwhore, and from the first page Caitlin refers to Callen that way 🙄 Like how many ways do you need to be told “he’s just not that into you”???? The reality is- if he was, he wouldn’t be a manwhore, and he’d be moving all those roadblocks he claims are in the way of pursuing her. I said what I said. As if being rejected while naked the first time wasn’t enough, she actually does it AGAIN, dropping her dress after a night out when she pretends to be too drunk to walk so he’ll carry her home 🙄 It still felt like childish games to me. So….. rough start for me. I didn’t believe he really had feelings for her. Definitely not the “it was always you” kind. She felt like an obsessed foolish crushing tween girl. Not a grown ass adult ready for a big girl relationship ::big sigh:: But, big but…I did buy it later. He was all-in when she is pregnant. And when things go south (which I LOATHED her dad for btw), he never wavers in working to get her back. I loved that she held firm in her anger towards the domineering men in her life. She didn’t just let it go. Loved it. The biggest win for me is the family aspect. I love this crazy family. I love the connections, the bickering, the texts, all of it. That’s what really saved this for me when I was struggling to get into their relationship initially. There’s a lot of family dynamics, so hopefully that’s your thing. Because they’re amazing.",4
"408","211835409","Callen and Caitlin took me through an emotional rollercoaster. I loved their story and found myself relating to Caitlin's pregnancy/birth experience since I had something similar. I wanted to punch the men in Caitlin's life a lot... but they loved her. Second Generation series have my heart because it truly feels like the story comes full circle. Looking forward to the next book!",5

"410","211835409","RATING: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️SPICE🔥🔥💥So freaking good! If Bella writes it, Im going to read it, that's an absolute given! But I was not prepared to love an accidental pregnancy trope as much as I did. It takes a lot for me to rate this trope a full five stars, but of course Bella would make it easy, because Caitlin and Callen were EVERYTHING.I love them. 10/10 no notes. This book is utter perfection. The angst, the feels the swooniness, it was all TOP TIER.✨Football Romance✨ Brother's Best Friend✨ Accidental Pregnancy✨ Second ChanceCallen and Caitlin have known each other since they were young, and she is his best friend's very off limits little sister. She's also had a thing for Callen since she was young, and one night, he quits fighting his very real feelings for her an they get a little surprise in the form of two pink lines.These two gave me every single emotion I could have. I cried, and when I say cried, I mean this book made me full on sob. I was a mess but this was one of the best payoffs for an HEA that Ive ever read, and every emotion I felt was absolutely worth it.And Callen Sinclair... this man. THIS MAN! He was so much more than I expected and everything I could have ever wanted, This man was so sure, so steady and so steadfast in getting his seined chance with the woman he loves. The way he showed up and groveled was fantastic and Caitlin made him work for it.What I love about Bella's world is how much family and frienships play a huge part in every story and Redeeming had all my favorites showing up, which of course I loved.Just read this. Its fantastic.",5
"411","211835409","Buckle up, Redeeming is going to squeeze your heart, shatter it, and then put it back together in a more beautiful way with Caitlin and Caleb’s story. WOW. I got completely swept away in their journey that before I knew it, it was over and all k wanted was more of these two. Callen and Caitlin have grown up around each other and been in each other’s life for a long time now and that doesn’t make it easy when you start to get feelings that can’t be ignored, but what else are they going to do. Then one night, a small crack is left in that open instead of closed door and now might be the time. However, in life nothing can ever be easy and just work out. Callen and Caitlin have intense chemistry and a connection with each other, but it is not always that simple. Especially when you have an overprotective brother who’s a roommate and best friend, then add in all the family drama and friends, if these two want to make it work, they will have to fight for what they want. The question is will they or will they let others decide for them? I loved the this book and all our favorite characters and their hilarious banter. I cannot wait for the next one!",5
"412","211835409","This is probably my favourite book written by Bella! I loved it so much. I managed to read it in one day because like all of Bella’s books I’ve read, this was fast-paced & entertaining from start to finish. It was also funny & super sweet, & the ending was very emotional & tense & had me crying so much! But it was a beautiful conclusion to Caitlin’s & Callen’s story🥹Caitlin was such a wonderful character. She’s stubborn, loud, bold, opinionated, sarcastic, unapologetically herself & knows how to stand up for herself. Callen is protective, loyal, honest, romantic, charming, & determined to win his girl back. His apologies & grovelling we’re SO sweet & romantic. There is tension right from the start, a push & pull, bickering & great banter.

But there’s a reason for that, he’s been secretly pining for his best friend’s little sister, the Mafia princess Caitlin Beneventi. Caitlin has made it clear to him there’s feeling there over the years but Callen has kept his distance from his best friend’s sister…. Until he can’t.And when they finally give in imagine their surprise to find out Caitlin is pregnant! I also love the text banter between the guys and Callens family chat! There were some tough topics throughout the book too so check your triggers if you have them but as always Bella handles them beautifully. 10000% recommend this book.",5
"415","211835409","Redeeming by Bella Matthews was fabulous. I devoured the book and couldn't get enough. I loved it from start to finish. Callen and Caitlin were everything and more.The story is told in three parts and when I was at the end of the first part was mouth was hanging open. It was the worlds colliding and not in a great way.Callen has always secretly liked Caitlin. Caitlin has always not so secretly liked Callen. When the timing finally aligns and they finally get their moment, fate has something else in store.Callen is protective to a fault. Caitlin wants to be independent and make her own choices. She is a fighter and won't let anyone or anything hold her back. While they have their obstacles and surprises along the way, their connection is there through it all.My favorite book by Bella Matthews so far. I just loved it.Redeeming is a brother's best friend, spicy, surprise pregnancy, sports romance that you do not want to miss!",5
"416","211835409","4.5 ⭐️ Caitlin and Callen are getting their HEA and man is it hard fought. 🤍Football romance🤍Brother’s best friend🤍Accidental pregnancy🤍Friends to lovers🤍Roommates🤍Meddling family membersCaitlin and Callen are two side characters that we have seen a lot of in the last series and now we finally get to see them together. While most of the “falling in love” has been brewing for years, they finally give in to temptation one night that eventually leads to much, much more. You can tell that these characters are already undoubtedly in love with each other from the very beginning of the book. But there are people standing in the way of them being together. This book gives us all of the best parts of Bella Matthews’ books - the huge families and hilarious group chats. I’m excited to see what direction she takes the next book!",4
"417","211835409","Another great read from Ms. Matthews. Callen is now one of my top characters written by this author; he is determined, and I find that very appealing. Caitlin and Callen's story is tumultuous throughout the book. Callen hides his feelings, conflicted and frustrated over his feelings for Caitlin, his roommate. Caitlin is the only girl in her family, the princess, determined to make her own decisions. The story was a quick read for me, hard to put down, and told in three parts. Caitlin's secret thoughts head each chapter and are on point! I cheered as the two fought hard for their happiness, but almost threw the kindle several times while trying to figure it out. We know who is next, and I am excited to see what is in store for them. Thank you to the Author for the advanced copy; this is my voluntary review.",4

This may be my favorite Bella Matthews book yet, and I have read them all.Caitlin is one tough FMC, and I loved everything about Callen.

Let's also not forget the spice. 🔥🔥🔥.🍼 Surprise Pregnancy🏈 Football Player💝 Brother’s Best FriendsThis is book 2 in the Red Lips & White Lies series. This series and the Playing to Win series are the second generation characters, so the friend groups and families overlap. I definitely recommend them all.Thank you, Bella, for the ARC.",5
"419","211835409","Talk about all the feels!! Nothing will match the intensity of Callen and Cait! These two are nothing but straight chemistry!! Their interactions were laced with angst and oh boy are you in for some major surprises! The love that Callen holds and gives to Cait was absolutely beautiful because this woman is feisty! She’s head strong and can be a little bit of a brat (lol) but Callen knows how to handle her. He gives her space when she needs it but will push her and her buttons if there’s a need! I love getting to see some OG characters and I was worried there for a bit but Bella did everything so well! This series is proving to be one of the angstiest and for me I love angst so this is definitely a top fave book and series!",5
"420","211835409","This book destroyed me and I absolutely loved it. The emotions that Callen and Caitlin pulled out of me was astronomical.  From cover to cover It pulled me right into the bare bones and left me raw, I love it when a book makes me feel everything. Bella completely knocked this one out of the park, she makes every MMC hotter and hotter because Callen.. damn 🫠 there's something in this book that I never knew I needed.  Don't hesitate...run to read this or anything from Bella, her storytelling is phenomenal",5
"421","211835409","Another great sports romance by Bella Matthews! I devoured this one so quickly! So good!Callen and Caitlin sure go through the ringer with each other throughout this book. Caitlin has loved Callen all her life even before she knew what a crush was. Her older brother Maddox’s best friend. Callen swore to Maddox he wouldn't touch Caitlin even when he, too, shared the same feelings like she did. I loved how these two wanted their happiness and the spice, angst, and love was all there! I loved it!",5

This book was definitely an emotional one with both characters dealing with some heavy situations.Highly recommend, I can't wait for the next in the series.",5
"423","211835409","Callen Sinclair…… my goodness the cover model made me fall in love and then I read the book and OH MAN. Caitlyn and Callen are couple goals. They may have had to jump through some hoops, but when they finally get there THEY GET THERE. I love all the characters in Bella’s books. She just writes a different breed of people. This book is sweet and spicy in all the right places. The whole story line is great. I love how Cait stands up for herself and makes Callen work for it. This is one of my favorite reads of September by far. Bella did it again and I’m in awe of her!!",5

I don't know how she does it, but each book gets better & better. This one was definitely one that will pull your heart strings!Caitlin is a the princess of the Kingston family with ties to the mafia(not that anyone can confirm it). She's had everything she's ever wanted, except for the man she's loved since she was 6 years old, Callen Sinclair. Now she's about to have his baby after he broke her heart for the second time.Callen made a promise to his best friend years ago & now he's fighting the struggle of his life. Caitlin has always had a special place in his heart and ad years went on, his feelings grew. After 4 years of living together, Callen is ready to make Caitlin his, until he has to walk away in orde to protect her.I've been waiting for Callen's book for 5 books now and Bella did not disappoint! I knew Callen would be a simple loving character, yet with a complex back story. Like Caitlin said Callen says & acts how people expect him to act, but in private his true self appears. Callen has been the comical relief in previous books & seeming him in this new light was satisfying. He isn't the superficial character with no care in the world, but in fact a strong man that will do anything for the ones he loves.Caitlin is a lot like Callen, she is strong, stubborn, & independent, but she also has times when she needs someone to lean on & be vulnerable with. I loved that Callen was that person for her and she was that person for him.Caitlin has been treated like a princess by everyone, so finding out why Callen broke things off & Maddox (her brother) hurting Callen, she felt betrayed. Her ""heart to heart"" with Maddox brought tears to my eyes. All she's ever wanted was to be friends with her brother, but he always pushed her away.While there definitely was groveling involved, I loved that Callen & Caitlin finding each other again, was more of Caitlin learning to let go of her stubbornness(while still knowing her worth) and learning to accept that people love in different ways, that might not align with her perspective of love. I absolutely loved the dynamic of the Sinclair siblings! While Callen was 20 years younger than them, they still loved Callen & truly treated him like a baby brother. The closeness of Cooper & Callen warmed by heart! Daddy Sinclair kindly telling both Callen & Caitlin to get their crap together was some of my favorite parts of the story! I do wish we got a scene of Daddy Sinclair & Baby Sinclair.Overall this was a wholesome, emotional rollercoaster, that had me laugh & crying throughout the whole book! I can't thank Bella enough for yet another amazing story!",5
"427","211835409","Caitlin has always been the princess of her family. Being the only daughter of the head of a mafia family, she has had a lot of times when decisions were made for her. For as long as she can remember she has liked Callen. The problem is, that Callen is her brother’s best friend. Callen has been told by his best friend in no uncertain terms that his sister is off-limits. He has been keeping his feelings at bay for four years, but living under the same roof has taken its toll and they both give in to the feelings for one night. When that one night leads to a surprise pregnancy, the cat’s out of the bag and everyone knows what happened between the two of them. I was excited to see how this book would go. We have Caitlin Beneventi, whose dad is part of the mafia, as well as an overprotective brother in Maddox. I loved Caitlin in this book. She stood up to everyone and stood her ground. Caitlin had such strength through all that happened with both Callen and her family. With her strength, we also saw her stubbornness. I thought Callen was such a sweetheart. Doing what he thought was right, he worked hard to regain Caitlin’s trust. I loved how willing he was to tell Maddox and his family about them being together, it was refreshing to see rather than hiding. As with any book in the Kroydon Hills universe, we have several characters from previous books coming in offering advice and friendships to both Caitlin and Callen. I did love that we got to see more of Caitlin’s brothers, as well as music star Lilah. I’m excited to see whose story we will get next! This book was both heartbreaking and comforting. You will go through a range of emotions, often from page to page. Callen and Caitlin are imperfect, but their love is beautiful.This book has one of my typically least favourite tropes in an accidental pregnancy, but Bella Matthews managed to make me love this story and brought me to tears. I loved Callen and Caitlin together and their story was wonderful. You can read this book as a standalone, but all of her books are connected and I recommend reading all the stories for a greater depth of knowledge of the characters you encounter. I’ve always loved Bella’s writing and this book truly knocked it out of the park. If you love a book with heart, this would be the perfect one for you! Thank you to the author for an advanced copy of this book. All opinions are 100% mine. Read if you like: brother’s best friend, football romance, black cat energy, touch her and die, surprise pregnancy, forbidden romance",5
"428","211835409","3.5 Stars. What a roller coaster read! I was instantly hooked by Cait and Callen. These two were such strong personalities and I loved that they had this complex and deep rooted history that just lent their romance that extra Umph that I love!Callen and Cait have been fighting their feelings for each other for years and when things finally tip over the edge, it's an angsty, funny, heart wrenching, bump journey to a HEA. But it was worth the wait and all the emotional tension and anxiety it caused because these two were awesome! I laughed, cried, wanted to reach in a smack some sense into them at times but overall I was rooting for them to be strong enough to lay their hearts and their truths out in the open and finally get their happily ever after. Callen was the best, I loved him and totally get why he did what he did. In a perfect world he wouldn't have had bend to the will of her father but come on! When a mafia boss with dark connections tells you to distance yourself because it's life or death, not many would contradict that! So yeah, did I wish Cait would have snapped out of her funk a little bit faster? Hell yes! Normally I love a good long grovel but in this instance, I felt like Callen deserved a break and Cait ending up sulking a little too much for my taste. In the end, it all worked out but the emotional back and forth was exhilarating and a touch exhausting, tbh.If you haven't followed the original series, your gonna be back tracking to read the other book couples and you might feel a little overwhelmed by all the side characters - these are big interconnecting families!- that make appearances here but the extra attention will be worth it because everyone sounds amazing and I'm personally excited to read this author's previous works, now more than ever. Highly recommend if you love good banter, flirting, fighting attraction, childhood crushes and surprise pregnancy tropes.

"432","40944965","worst $6 i have ever spent in my mf life. reading this book was the equivalent to ripping out each individual hair follicle on my head. i actually can't believe i avoided every spoiler on this book like the mf plague thinking this series was gonna be a banger. all that hard work for nothing. wattpad, i'm so sorry for ever comparing this book to you. i've read books on wattpad a million times better than whatever the fuck i just read. alright lets begin. the length. the length of this book is enough to make me go dizzy. 626 pages in the copy i had, but other copies have over 800 pages. what is going on here? chloe walsh, may i introduce you to an editor perhaps? this book did not need to be as long as it was. and i genuinely thought since it was so long there would actually be shit happening in the book. i was mistaken. the book had absolutely nothing going on for about 99% of it, and that's me being generous. chloe walsh must have thought she was saving the environment the way she recycled every single conversation and plot overnovernovernover again. basically just johnny driving shannon home every day and them having the same conversations. didn't realize he was signing up to be her chauffeur. shannonwhy in the fucking hell did i need to hear how small shannon like the river is every 5 seconds? there is absolutely no reason for me to be reading about how small she is the number of times i did. WE FUCKING GET IT. i was tired of it by the second page. yes, the second page. you read that correctly. it had already been mentioned at least 5 times by then. and then a million more times afterwards. shannon like the river and her tiny bone structure. she's so small and unable to do anything for herself. she needs literally anyone else to help her do the most basic human tasks. the way this character is infantilized and then sexualized is disturbing. they constantly remind us of how tiny she is and how she acts like a child. she legitimately cannot do anything without needing help from someone else. you would think she would have some sort of development by the end of the book but she remains unchanged. her whole home life plot is explored so little you could literally forget its a factor. the book had more than enough pages to delve into that plot. but all we're supposed to care about is this girl's constant loop of a relationship with the popular rugby player. not the reason why she is literally emotionally and physically stunted. she acts like a child but we're told she's actually ""mature"" lol okay. and then they love to mention her body every 5 seconds and how hot johnny and other boys find her.johnnygenuinely thought his name was josh the entire first half of the book. i hate this kid. all he did was talk about his dick for half the book, and how hot and tiny shannon like the river is and everything he wanted to do to her. being inside his head was the most painful experience of my life. the repetitive nonstop inner monologues really made me homicidal. pure torture it was putting myself through this. i could skip pages and still wind up back in the same spot. he loved to create problems for him and shannon like the river out of thin air. one of the dumbest characters i've read about in a while. it was fun laughing at him sometimes though so at least there's that.where was the love? the chemistry? the connection? there was over 600 pages and somehow nothing to convince me these two were made for each other. johnny needs to get his ass back to dublin and shannon like the river needs years of therapy and a stable household. anyways see below the big josh and tiny shannon. how lovely!joeyhe barely was in this book but he is the only good thing in it. carried the book. there is no way i would enjoy any other book in this series, but this man is a gem. i will appreciate his character from afar but i truly do love him so much. i brought the review back bc fuck the bullies yall can stay mad. ───when the plan to br finally makes it out the dms 🤭 iqra lets hope we love it or hate it together <3",1
"433","40944965","it’s been a long time since I’ve read a book where i don’t want it to end.i was expecting this book to be the typical high school romance where jock meets shy girl and ya it kinda is but it’s definitely much more. i love books that focuses on the characters, friendships, relationships and family dynamics and this book has all of it. tbh, i wasn’t gonna read this book but the rating is so high and i was curious and all but i’m so glad i did. ALSO, i wasn’t expecting this book to have a Mariana Zapata type of slow burn and i was all for it. and i know this book is long af but it’s like that because there’s more showing than telling and i loved this. 
  story & characters
this book is long af but it didn’t feel long. if books are like this, you know it’s really freakin good and it is. what drew me in are the characters. the story is pretty simple: girl gets bullied in her old school, she transfers to a more preppy/private school, she meets the most popular guy who also happens to be a rugby prodigy, they fall in love slowly but they both hide it from each other cuz duh its forbidden and all that. you know the drill. but the characters? fucking great. they were so relatable, hilarious, and the banter? the best thing i’ve read in a long time. the side characters, Gibsie (H bff) and Claire (h bff) are THE BEST. i don’t think i’ve ever laughed so hard, i feel nonexistent abs forming on my tummy until Gibsie is introduced in my book-life. and Claire? she’s the kind of friend every girl needs. both of these characters’ loyalty and support was so refreshing to read, i just love em and i ship both of these characters so bad too. 
  Shannon (h) & Johnny (H)
i felt so bad for Shannon that i just wanted to protect her from every single person who bullied and abused her. and knowing and reading about how she was being abused by her father? ughhhhh MY HEART. Shannon may seem weak, innocent, awkward, and naive (which is understandable after what she’s been through), but she’s actually so fucking strong, mature, the sweetest thing ever, and quite admirable tbh. and omfg Johnny is the best hero i’ve read in a loooong time. he’s the perfect balance of sweet and alpha/protective/possessive type of hero. even though his pushing away from the heroine and implicitly leading her on frustrated me to no end, i’m still really glad that he was the one doing most of the chase. he may say to her he’s not interested but i mean, actions speak louder than words right? im also so glad that Shannon calls Johnny out when he makes mistakes instead of just “giving in” just because, you know, he’s hot. ugh *cue eyeroll*. i’ve seen this trend in soo many NA books that it’s annoying as hell but thank god Shannon ain’t one of those weak and doormat/horny heroines. 
  drama
wellll most of the drama here is the push and pull from both MCs, it can get frustrating, not gonna lie, but it’s definitely worth it. the OW drama here was kinda entertaining but also kinda not important? i don’t know it just feels like it’s there for the sake of drama or putting a wedge between the MCs and im honestly not complaining because i’ve been in the mood for petty teenage drama for quite a while. anywaysss, this book doesn’t have sex in it and it focuses a lot more on the stages of slowly and innocently (but genuinely) falling in love with your soulmate so if you like that, i recommend this 100%.",5
"434","40944965","“now tell me who made you cry & i’ll fix it”i don’t think i’ll ever recover from this story. johnny is officially my favorite ❤️‍🩹",5
"435","40944965","""Boom, boom, fucking boom... I'm done for.""  Am honestly at a loss for words. I loved this book so much, it's  definitely one of my favorites  from now on. Y'all that ending was so heart breaking and yet I find myself being happy and loving that pain cause the book was THAT good.  In no way it's a perfect book, it's flawed and the writing may not work for everyone, the pacing is slow but the characters and story are simply captivating.  In this  character driven story,  you'll find yourself rooting for them, understanding their pain and trauma, focusing on relationships, family dynamics and their growth as individuals. ✔️ Sports romance (rugby) ✔️ High School romance✔️ Slow burn✔️ Dual pov✔️ Set in Ireland during the timeframe of 2005✔️ Found family✔️ ""Who did this to you"" It's only after I bought the whole series that I found out it's a high school romance, it did make me skeptical yet it worked out brilliantly. I especially loved how the actual sport played an important part in the story. I absolutely LOVE watching rugby, so having the inclusion of that made it even a better experience for me. Coming to the characters,  Shannon and Johnny  have my heart. These two are so adorable and so smitten by each other. I loved seeing them progress as strangers, to friends and eventually finally accepting their feelings for each other. The romance is so sweet and had me giggling.  🩷Shannon  is one of those characters who deserve the whole freaking world. She's been through so much, I wish I could give her the biggest hug. I honestly don't understand how people can find her annoying. Poor girl is so vulnerable and to see her open her heart and start trusting Johnny was such a proud moment for me. I hate what's happening to her. I wish she would reach out and accept help, I simply wish someone would save her and her brothers 😭  🏉Johnny  is a fun, dorky and such a loving character. I admire his dedication to rugby and how loyal his teammates are to him, and he to them. His persona instantly puts people at ease and also the guy is straightforward- me likey. But to see him put himself through so much pain to achieve his goals was heartbreaking. I found myself relating to some of his struggles as I have been going through the same, so he does have a soft spot in my heart. I loved the scene in the hospital when he was high tbh, it was funny and so honest from him lol. The  side characters  are equally impactful and so easy to like.  Joey  is someone am really rooting for. I want to see him happy so bad it breaks my heart. I want to get to know  Aoife  more, she seems so sweet.  Claire and Gibsie?  Oh gosh, I ship it so hard 😩😩 I love Gibsie, he's so loyal and the sense of humor is elite lol.  Lizzy  seems upfront and seems to be hiding her own struggles but that's all I know about her. Shannon's parents and Bella can die, if I start ranting about how much I hate them this review will never end. The  ending  broke me as it ends on a sad and brutal note. I was expecting it to happen yet it hurt so bad. I have so much hope for the next book, hopefully will love it the same if not more.  Highly recommended.  Please check trigger warnings before reading this book. ~•~•~Am so intimidated by the size of this book but IT'S TIMEEEEEE",5
"436","40944965","DNF @ pg 231.i went into this book hoping for a fun time and not take it too seriously but it was just horrendous.there were like two cute moments but other than that the writing was bad, i was not invested and there were some lines that made me gasp out loud because of how gross they are (e.g. ableist, transphobic, misogynistic) e.g.:- the main character says how her eyes are ""too big"" for her face so she tries to squint. ""the squinting only made me look disabled"" ??????? this was on page one so i should have KNOWN not to trust it would get any better- ""a girl, a fucking female""- the main guy johnny to one of his guy friends: ""i hurt your feelings? who's the bitch with a vagina now?""anyway, save yourselves & don't read this book 😅",1

  JOHNNY KAVANAGH FANS LOOK AWAY!!
The first 200 pages of this book were absolutely horrendous, atrocious, the worst 200 pages that I have ever read in my life. I was so bleckh'd out by the fact that shannon was 15 and the amount of dick talks and dick mentions in Johnny's chapter was so infuriating like every fucking second you'd look at the book and it would Johnny and his dick being described LIKE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP MENTIONING HIS POGO STICK+ the actual meaning of binding 13 💀💀. However, the remaining 600 pages were so much better, such a massive improvement, it captivated me and I enjoyed it soo much and the fact that I read it fast. I was topping because my house was getting fumigated so had to look at that and the moving took a lot of my time but this never let me let go of its grip. I would say I loved Shannons story and it gripped so much more than Johnny's, his was ok, I preferred reading about Shannon more. Her chapters were the redeeming part in my opinion.
  “¨I think I need you for keeps.¨¨I think I need you for keeps, too.¨”
Johnny Kavanagh, He was such an asshole. I loved him when he was Shannon but when he was not? I hated him. He was a manwhore with the way he passed on from one woman to another but that was before Shannon and we didnt get enough page time so it did not bother me, what bothered me was the fact that he treated his friends like they were trash, threatening them, snapping at them. I remember hughie asking if he wanted lunch and Johnny was talking to shannon and instead of politely declining 'Fuck off' He snapped like come on man! and the way he treated Gibsie and all, I would never treat my friends like that, besides that I dont understand why he would punch the boyfriends of the girls who bullied Shannon when it wasn't even their fault like?? they dont control them?? and what would he do if that girl didnt have a bf? anyways, to the bfs who bullied shannon it was understandable but Cormac? did they not smooth things over? yes, they did but he still punched her for the doings of Bella even tho Cormac had nothing to do with it. What an asshole. Also, I love Joey and he was a bitch to him so -1 point for that. However his scenes with Shannon made me like him a lot, I love how considerate he was of her and how her life got better because of him and how much effort he put in for her.Shannon Lynch, My heart broke for her. I did not care for anyone besides her and Joey. I loved her story so much and ugh I hated what she went through if only I could give her a big hug and take all of her siblings with her to somewhere safe because I cannot imagine spending your childhood like that, so full of horror and trauma. it wasn't just her house but her school, her community. I was so pissed!! I could see her frustration, her anger and her resolve, her breakdown. It was actually heartbreaking to see what she went through but her story was so engaging and loved how her story was so easily redeemable.Joey, Aoife, Bella, Mam and Da, its a disgrace to put Joey and Aoife with them but I had to because I love them and I cant wait to read their story, Bella, Ma and Da can rot in hell.
  “I carefully scrolled through his playlists and almost had a heart attack when my eyes landed on the one named Songs for Shannon.”
The romance was actually so sweet. I loved the slow burn and it was actually nice to see that they weren't in each others throats every two minutes. I enjoyed the sweet moments we got between them, Johnny really did care for her and gave her everything, I would like to see how their romance progresses in the next book considering the events of the end and how Johnny doesn't know but it was refreshing to see how it unraveled through this book.Overall, a solid novel!! (I didnt cry Hoda, gimme 100 dollars pls)___Hoda and Rowan have been dying for me to read this and this also won my poll + i heard its like shameless so I am very excited to read Johnny and Shannon's story!",4
"438","40944965","This was so, so good...Excellent character building.Excellent relationship building. Just excellent all around. I loved the Ireland backdrop and the prep school setting, not to mention all of the hard-hitting topics. I would gush more, but am short on time here. I am also dying for the second book and pissed that I have to work 12+ hour days the next three days and will have no time to read it until Saturday. I don't know why I haven't read this author before, but am now adding her entire back-list to my tbr.",5
"439","40944965","5 boom boom fucking boom stars “I think I need you for keeps,” he slurred. “I think I need you for keeps, too,” I confessed.This book did something like boom boom fucking boom to my heart. I absolutely, wholeheartedly, deeply, madly and truly love Johnny and Shannon. There's this saying that you don't find a book but a book finds it way to you and it's so true because I have been ignoring this series for over a year but this year I finally caved in and guess who's obsessed? ME! I was just 10 chapters in the story and I already knew I was going to give it 5 stars. He smiled down at me. “Hi, Shannon.” “Hi, Johnny,” I whispered, staring back at him, feeling like my heart was two seconds away from bursting out of my chest.I was a bit scared to read this because I rarely read high school romances where teenagers behave like a bunch of rich kids who thinks they are the king of the world. But this book was so realistic in terms of high school trope and I loved how Chloe actually didn't wrote her characters as some rich assholes who are too good for the world. All the characters were teenagers going through that crazy and young phase but they were written in such a real and realistic way. Yes, there were some cringy and cliché moments but they are teenagers so it was absolutely understandable.“She was nice to think about. She was fucking beautiful. Her voice. Her hair. Her smell. The way she spoke. Every single part of her.”The plot is more of character-driven and the pacing was slow but I definitely don't mind it because I never wanted to end this book. Chloe can write ten books about Johnny and Shannon doing dumb ass shit and I would still read them with hearts in my eyes. I loved the writing because it was easy to read and captivating and it worked well for me because it's a 500 plus pages book. This might be not everyone's writing style because there was no flowery euphemisms or allegories. I love how the story was not just focused on the romance part. The character's development was slow but done so well and there's still a lot to unpack in Keeping 13 but I love it because healing is not a linear and I would love if there is a real growth to Shannon and Johnny's character. I also loved the found family trope in this one.“Look at me,” he repeated, tone calm and coaxing. I couldn’t. I felt him shift beside me and then his fingers were on my chin, tipping my face up to his. “You’re safe,” he whispered, cupping my cheek in his hand, eyes boring holes straight through my soul. “I promise.”This book is the slowest slow-burn I have ever read in my life and I didn't hated a bit even though I was dying for them to kiss each other and when that happened I was literally dead because they are so adorable. The way they met for the first time was so funny and adorable and I immediately knew right then that they are going to be my new obsession and my new comfort couple. I have never felt this many butterflies in my stomach while reading a book about two teenage people who are madly in love with each other but refuse to accept their feelings.“Well, thanks for caring,” I breathed. “Thanks for being worth it,” Johnny replied, hand still on my cheek.➸ Shannon LynchThe girl with sad eyes. The moment I saw her I had this immediate need to protect her from the world. Her story broke my heart 🥺 She deserves the best in the world. Shannon's is such a vulnerable and fragile girl with the biggest and the kindest heart in the world. She's the quiet one with the traumatic childhood and school experience who just wanted a clean slate at a new school. I hate how people treated her at her old school and I'm glad Johnny beat the shit out of them for calling her out by names. She's used to being alone, has trust issues, build a huge wall around herself to protect her, never had anyone by her side except her brother Joey. She's been dealing through a shit life and has no self-confidence and self-esteem because people treated her like shit all her life. I hate it when the authors or the mmc can't shut up about how the fmc is so small and short and tiny and Chloe did exactly the same but I think it was done to portrayed her character as vulnerable or fragile girl and to make readers empathise with her. She has a lot to heal and move on from in her life but she's doing it all her pace with Johnny and her loved ones by her side.“For once in my life, I wanted a safe place to run to instead of from. I felt like I was slowly dying in that house. In my home. Where I was supposed to lay my head. Where I was supposed to feel safe.”➸ Johnny KavanaghHE IS THE DEFINITION OF BOY OBSESSED AND WHO DID THAT TO YOU TROPE. He's broody and a bit grumpy with all that ""Rugby is my life"" attitude but he's so thoughtful, respectful, caring, and just incredible. He has DIMPLES AND HE LOVES DOGS? HE'S PERFECT! I hate it when man picks fight for their woman like she can't do that herself but Johnny is an exception. I'd let him slay all my dragons if he wants to. He did that with Shannon, fought on her behalf, threatened the kids at his school to not talk shit about her and it's not because he's strong and all, it was because he wanted and needed to protect her and he wanted her to protect him in some way. His povs were everything! He's a very strong minded person with a very obsessive personality. No matter how perfect he appears to all the other people, Johnny is such a scared boy with dreams and hopes. He has his own demons and fears that can destroy his career and I get it why he tried to hide his injury from everyone because no body wants to see how you can lose everything you have worked for your whole life destroy right in front of your eyes.“Problem was, every time she ran, I found myself chasing right after her, desperate to just be with her.”╰┈➤ Shannon & JohnnyRight person, Right time.They make my heart go like WOAH. They are complete opposites of each other in terms of status, personality and upbringing. He wants to save her and she wants to hide from her past and everything. She's a damaged soul but he's determined to save her and love her. They had me swooning and giggling at Every. Damn. Moment. The giddiness I felt when they were in formed proximity and when Johnny was driving her to home and everytime he threatened the kids at school to stay away from “My Shannon” (don't love it when they lay claims on woman but it's Johnny so he can do anything to me). He had a playlist of songs that reminded him of her and they were all love songs and he spent thirty minutes in rain trying to find her shoe and you are telling me he is fictional 😭 He tried to find ways to spend time with her because his heart didn't wanted to let go of her. “Someone touched you,” Johnny whispered in my ear, placing his fingers on the marks. “I want to know who.”“Now,” I sneered, glaring down at their faces. “Who wants to call my girlfriend a whore to my face?”“Give me a name,” Johnny growled, dropping his hands to his hips. “And I’ll take care of it.” “What— no! I’m grand,” I quickly replied. “I have allergies.” “Me too. To assholes and bullshit,” Johnny snarled. “Now, tell me who made you cry and I’ll fix it.”The feminist in me is dead after meeting Johnny Kavanagh🤸🏽‍♀️He wanted to be her friend but also couldn't be her friend and all the dilemma, confusions, denials and bulldozing (Iykyk) worked so well in the end. I love that they just didn't had this lust and tension between them but they also had an emotional and intimate connection. They understood each other so well and helped each other in their own way. They had this easy going relationship and friendship. The way Johnny made everything easy for Shannon at school, the way he protected her, loved her, took care of her everytime, and the way Shannon saw the real Johnny behind Johnny the perfect boy and the perfect rugby player. Johnny was so patient with her and waited for her to open up to him about her abusive life. How he was afraid of talking to her about his insecurities and fears yet he tried his best with her. They are just so so prefect for each other. Definitely soulmates!“Shannon.” Johnny’s hand snaked out and wrapped around my wrist. “I don’t want you to go,” he said gruffly, tugging me back down beside him. “I want you here.” He rested a hand on the bed right behind my back and leaned close. “I want you to stay with me.”— Side Characters —➸ Joey: Perfect brother and I already love him. Can't wait to read his book but I already know his book is going to break my heart in pieces.➸ Aoife: She's so precious and I love the way she's always there for Joey and his family.➸ Claire: Love love love her. She's the best with her kind-hearted spirit and sweet nature. She's the type of friend who would hype you up all the damn time.➸ Gibsie: He was a bit annoying in the start but his character grew on me a lot. His friendship with Johnny is so precious. I can't wait for his book. Claire and Gibsie literally behaved like a married couple in this book. He follows her, cracks weird jokes and Claire retorts with her witty replies.➸ Lizzie: The ice queen of their group. A bit annoying but I love whoever loves Shannon.The hospital scene at the end is my roman empire and it was so adorable, so cute, so comforting. Just everything.“I’m keeping her, Da.” “Okay, son,” he coaxed. “You keep the girl.” “She makes my heart go, like, whoa.” “Is that right?” he mused. “So bad, Da.” I sighed. “Boom, boom, fucking boom.” I shook my head. “All the time.”The ending broke my heart because Shannon didn't deserve that 😭, but I'm hoping for a better life for her in Keeping 13. “If this is love, then it’s you,” he replied, dragging me down to lie beside him.“You are love.” He sighed contently. “Stay with me.” Always. “I’ll stay with you,” I whispered, feeling more in this moment than I could handle.💌 This is not just a story about a girl who was mentally and physically abused by her father and her classmates. It's not just about romance or friendships. It's about how to let someone in your life and how to develop your trust again and how to fall in love while also figuring out your fears and insecurities. It's about letting yourself move on from the life of difficulties and pain and trauma. It's about finding comfort, a home, a sense of security and love in other people. It's also about dreams and how to overcome your fear of losing them. It's about healing. It's just about life ❤️‍🩹——————————Definitely worth all the damn hype in this world! I AM SO OBSESSED WITH JOHNNYSHANNON 😭 AND I WANT MORE. RTC!! ——————————let's see what all the hype is about 🤸🏽‍♀️",5

this book. this series. these characters. the Johnny being high on drugs in the hospital scene at the end of the book will always live in my mind forever and always. Mariana Zapata: Hi, my name is Mariana Zapata and what you should know about me is that I write super long slowburn romances.Chloe Walsh: hold my fucking beer.Chloe Walsh:*goes on to write a highschool-coming-of-age story that is over 800+ pages long where all the H and h do is kiss for like maybe 3 times and it's glorious* I'd love to write a review for this, but 1. my emotions are all over the place right now after that cliffhanger. What the hell???2. I have other things to do like start the sequel to this book which is over 900 pages ...so uhm... excuse me, but I have other priorities. Just know that I'm taking custody of all the boys of Tommen. This needs to be enough for now.I've finished both books and decided to write one extremely long review for both Binding 13 and Keeping 13 HERE. What to expect: lots of tears & mental breakdowns. #1 Binding 13 ↠ 4.25 stars#2 Keeping 13 ↠ 5 stars",4
"441","40944965","5 MILLLIONNNNN STARS⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ i’m beyond obsessed. no review could do this book justice but wow. i’m SPRINTING to keeping 13!!!!!",5
"442","40944965","4.5*I had no intention of writing a review but the words were banging around my brain screaming to be let out so here we are. . . I was completely hooked from the start. The writing was so easy to read, it was very straight forward. After reading Nocticadia, the simplicity was exactly what I needed. The story felt very mindless from the beginning to middle of the book but it really picked up after that. This book is not perfect at all. Despite that I adore the characters and their relationships both familial and romantic. Shannon is my traumatised lovable sweet and smol pookie 😭 I actually feel for her sfb. I just wanna give her a hug for 15373747 years it’s not fairrrrrr 💔The heartache from reading about her past and seeing how she suffered sm brought me to tears. I felt like jumping into the book and using all the tools in the universe to get retribution on everyone who hurt her istg- 🔪I can understand how her size and age being emphasised again and again could annoy anyone really but to me it just drills in the fact that all this was happening to a fifteen year old girl that should’ve been living her life normally. Her house, her home, the place she rests her head(!!) is supposed to allow her to de-stress and find some peace. What should’ve been her sanctuary was actually the most destructive place for her. Her small frame is directly linked to this as well. It’s really shitty to read about and I hate this for her (ಡ_ಡ)There wasn’t much of Shannon being carefree but she was adorable asf when she was in her element. Them playing GTA was the most I’ve seen her let go and gahhhh I loved every second of it 🤭💗🫂*Johnny is the most precious guy ever. What I love the most about him is that when he feels really solid about what he wants, he goes after it with his all. But what came out of his all or nothing attitude towards life hurttttttt ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹Him being indecisive about whether he wanted to pursue a relationship with Shannon was so valid. The reservations he’s kept and been reiterating in his head for years, about how his profession isn’t gonna leave any room for a relationship, that can’t just be broken down within seconds. It’s frustrating to read about sure but I understand the reason behind it. Watching him go from being calculated and orderly to berserk and punching her bullies had me going ferallll andjdhdj 💃 It shows exactly how much she’s affected him and his life. Ugh I love him sfmmmm 🥹💗💗That hospital chapter was worth EVERYTHINGHHH 🤧✋ he made my heart go woah fr.  He was actually so funny omfdssss. There were so many times he had me howling bc of his one liners 😭 he’s iconic, it’s true.  Him being so adorableeeeee towards Shannon and the small moments between them had me shaking screaming dying. I love them together sfm it hurts. When he would thread his hand through her hair and ask for consent to hug her? ☝️. . . 💃🚂 his affectionate touches? *sigh*HIM MAKING A PLAYLIST THAT REMINDS HIM OF HER?? 🤸🕳️Even the little things he would do like holding her bag or giving her his jacket?searching for her lost shoe in the rain??? EVERYTHING. It all got to me. I’m obsessed. Gibsieeee my best boi. I absolutely adore the shit outta this guy. He’s my top man. The way he made me laffff so fucking loud at the most inopportune moments ugh chefs kiss. Especially when he was annoying Johnny abt his ~problems~ Omf I was wheezing. (He gives Seth vibes so hard I’m in loveeeee 🙏) Also the sum sum we’re getting with him and claire is not enough!!! I need moreee 😭Joey 😭😭 my heart goes out to him. This guy deserves to have everything in every universe. He’s the best brother. Him leaving Shannon there bc he couldn’t take it anymore killed me even tho I’m glad he put himself first (╥_╥)I wanna cry just thinking about the ending of this book 😭🔫 The only thing I will say is that this book has a certain style of writing that doesn’t fit everyone. But personally I felt like there’s something really effective in Chloe’s writing that makes me connect to the characters and their situations. What bugged me most was the fact that there were a lot of scenes that I felt were kind of pointless idk. For example the denial scenes, Iykyk. There were too many of them. One or two is fine but EIGHT?! That could’ve been cut down. Especially bc those scenes would be so long and their conversations would not add anything big to the plot. Also there’s a difference between him denying his love for Shannon and him being indecisive over wanting a relationship with her. The former just annoyed me a lot. However, there were certain scenes which were used again and again but I felt they were necessary. For example, JohnnyShannon and their drives or Johnny taking care of Shannon however he can. It’s important for this to be shown more than once bc Shannon needs to feel that steady stability, that removal of doubts, which he’s giving her by repeating those reassuring words and actions. She needs to feel like he’s a constant in her life and that he’s reliable enough to be her safe haven. Even though there’s a long way for them to reach that level of trust, these scenes are basically the groundwork to get there. I love that we got to see most of these scenes fully playing out and not just being told he drove her home BAM end scene yk? There was ONE part which I would’ve died for and that was when he took her to the cinema 😭 it’s not fairrrr! Chloe release that scene from the vault I beg 🔪So basically this book made me laugh like a hyena (mostly gibsie’s fault), cringe quite a bit, hunt for a grave to temporarily lie in, sport the biggest grin, vibrate with anxiety, lose years off my life, develop wrinkles, and cry. Definitely the crying :). . . I loved it <3 𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I’ve been spoiled for some couples in the series and I think I’m glad for it bc now I can get giddy over all their small interactions 🤭𝗦𝗼𝗻𝗴𝘀: 🎧My Boys of Tommen Playlist 𝗙𝗮𝘃 𝗤𝘂𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀: spoilers in this section!

 🩷tbh. idek how to start this review. like I have so many feelings and I don’t know how to put them into coherent sentences. this book will make you feel every emotion there is to feel. maybe even new ones, you didn’t know you had. it feels real yk? it feels like these are two actual people I’ve read about bc the story is that fleshed out and detailed <33 they’re my roman empire FOREVER AND EVER!! ok let me stop babbling now and get into the review LMFAO
  💌 plot 💌
I feel like most people know the plot of this book, but i’m gonna write it out anyways bc why not HAHAHA.shannon lynch has had a rough life. always picked on by the kids at school. shamed, teased, bullied. but she had it worse at home. the only girl amongst her 5 siblings and the easiest target for her father. any chance he gets, he will beat her to a pulp. after going through so much tormenting at school, her family decides to move her to tommen, ballylaggin’s most prestigious private school. that is where she meets the only boy that makes her feel safe. the love of my her life <33 and he shows her what it’s really like to be cared for, and loved.
  🍓 shannon lynch 🍓 
🤎 I once read somewhere that we mature with damage, not with age. 🤎she broke my heart. SHE’S JUST A KID!! but she basically raised 3 kids all on her own. she took care of sean, tahdg and ollie more than her mom ever did and it makes me SO MAD. all her mom did was cry for no reason whilst she watched her kids get ABUSED and TORMENTED 🙁a lot of people don’t like her too much bc she’s too stubborn or awkward but my god can you blame her? with that trauma, it’s impressive she can even trust anyone when she can’t feel safe around her own parents 💔💌I liked safe. In my world, invisibility equaled safety.I was happy to be wallpaper and blend in. 💌guys. she is literally my spirit animal. I know what it’s like to fear your own family. and it fucking sucks. being scared whenever they walk into a room, finding any possible excuse to leave the house, it’s genuinely horrible. when we are together, it always ends in me crying. there’s always something “imperfect” about me to comment on just so there’s a reason to yell. and that’s why I felt her to my core. she never did anything but she always suffered for absolutely no reason. just bc her dad felt like using a punching bag. like her, I don’t have a temper, I just sob, and sob, and sob.🧸 I was annoyed with myself for being the kind of person who cried when angry. I wanted to be a shouter. A shouter was much better than a crier. 🧸never did I want to jump into a book and give a character a hug as much as I did in this moment. shannon lynch, you are so strong <3
  🏉 johnny kavanagh 🏉
ohmygod. I can’t even talk about him without squealing like a lovesick teenage girl (newsflash: I am a lovesick teenage girl). he makes me so giddy it’s actually fucking WEIRD. and then I remember he’s just words and I get depressed. ask my bsf, I will vent to her about him for hours like he’s an actual PERSON.the most greenest forest in the universe. in a world of gross filthy boys, he is a gentleman and everything more 🥹 he cared for shannon in a way I’ve never seen with any other man. he was masculine and attractive, but without that toxicity and gross ego they usually have. he made her FEEL SAFE, when she thought she couldn’t with anyone else in the world. I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him.anyways. I love him. did I mention that? I don’t think I did.🎀I can take you home when you have to go? What the actual fuck? I might as well have shouted, love me, fucking love me at the girl. 🎀hey siri, play “you are in love” by taylor swiftBECAUSE MY GUY IS WHIPPED!! he’s so perfect, and he only had eyes on her when everyone else wanted him (me included) and she was literally ignoring him.☄️ Shannon Lynch had eyes the color of midnight blue that wouldn’t stay the fuck out of my head. ☄️…and this was shortly after they first met. I don’t even love the “love at first sight” thing but I was obsessed with it here that I didn’t even care. (it’s still a slow burn though dw 😉)
  🌺 other characters 🌺
🥃 joey lynch: he’s the best brother one could ever have. I wish I had him in my life he’s so supportive, so sweet, no matter how fucked up his life is, he’s still there to hold his siblings’ hand and support them (unlike darren 🙄) his book is so beautiful but heartbreaking please go read it and see how much my baby goes through <3 he’s so strong 💘 eden kavanagh: my favourite fictional mother <3 I love her so much, it’s no wonder johnny turned out so perfect!! she’s hilarious and so kind and sweet to shannon 😭💗🥳 gerard gibson: im scared for his book bc everyone says it sucks but i know no matter what, I will forever love him so much. he is the bestest friend johnny could’ve asked for, i love him with all my heart. everyone needs a bestie like gerard gibson in their life or they are missing out 🤍 🛍️ aoife molloy: im obsessed with her. you don’t see much of her here but in the rest of the books you see how perfect she is for Joey and the way she stuck by him no matter what 💗😵‍💫 shannon’s dad: disgusting excuse for a human being. he can rot in hell idc.

She hitched her leg over mine. ""Is that okay?"" Don’t do it. You'll never get over this girl. ""Yeah,"" I exhaled a ragged breath, feeling my heart smash against my ribcage, as she hovered above me. ""That's okay.""➼ ""You can't tell me what to do,"" he rasped, breathless. ""You're not my father!"" This fucker. He was determined to defy me even when he couldn’t win.

I still don't know how to feel about it, I really didn't even expect to like it this much, but I was really surprised.'she was like a tornado I never saw coming'First of all, I want to say that my dear giuls gave me this book for Christmas, and surely if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have read it, therefore, this book is even more special just because of you. I love you bleeding eejit.Returning to the book, I could say a few reasons why this book might not be 5.✰ stars, small details that in other books would make me lower the rating, but as I have said other times, 5.✰ stars is a feeling, not a set of objective things that a book has to bring together, if not a set of emotions that it has to make me feel. This book is not perfect objectively speaking, but it is perfect in my heart.‘Relax’ Johnny whispered in my ear, distracting me from my memories. ‘You are safe with me.’Before continuing with the review, I advise that, if you want to read the book, you check the trigger warnings first, since it deals with quite strong topics. Also make it clear that the love story is not the main plot, and that the main characters are TEENAGERS, they are 15/16 and 17 years old. Once this is noted, we can continue.

We follow Shannon Lynch, a 15-year-old girl with a very hard life, who due to constant bullying at her previous school, has transferred to Tommen, there, after an accident with a rugby ball, she meets Johnny Kavanagh, a young rugby promise, at this moment, everything changes for them, Johnny finds himself interested in something other than rugby for the first time in his life, and Shannon will find for the first time a feeling foreign to her, feeling safe.'come on, I'll look after you'If you're expecting a book full of plot twists or action, turn around and leave because this isn't it. I wouldn't say it's a character driven story, but it's not a plot story either. It's very slice of life. I know the length of the book is intimidating, but the writing is so fast and addictive that I read it as if it were 300 pages instead of 800.

*:･ﾟ｡ 𝑺𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒏𝒐𝒏 𝑳𝒚𝒏𝒄𝒉 *ੈ✩‧₊˚Better known as Shannon like the river. Shannon is a fragile girl, who has a very hard and complicated life, she doesn't trust anyone, only her brother Joey. Reading Shannon's points of views were really painful, her way of seeing life, her desperation, her fear, her pain, her feelings, I could feel her fear on my own skin.'I once read somewhere that we mature with damage, not with age'She is very innocent and sometimes her innocence created cringe moments where I wanted to hide under my blanket and not come out for the next three months, but at the same time it was funny because, at the end of the day, they are teenagers, and we all went through these things.*:･ﾟ｡ 𝑱𝒐𝒉𝒏𝒏𝒚 𝑲𝒂𝒗𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒈𝒉 *ੈ✩‧₊˚LISTEN TO ME. JOHNNY FUCKING KAVANAGH IS IT. HE IS THE STANDARD, AND WE DESERVE SOMEONE LIKE HIM, NOTHING LESS.Johnny is 17 years old, and he is a promising rugby player, his whole life revolves around that, his future plans and how he behaves, but there is a problem, Johnny had surgery not long ago, which still hasn't properly healed, and he still decides to play and put his health at risk for fear of being left without his opportunity.He is a very mature boy for his age, with enormous respect for girls. He immediately sees Shannon's fragility and feels that he must keep her safe. Shannon's age is very important to him, since he feels that he is too old for her. , which is understandable, but at the same time it was frustrating, since we all had a crush in high school older or younger than us, after all they are both teenagers.'tell me who made you cry and I'll fix it'*:･ﾟ｡ 𝑱𝒐𝒆𝒚 𝑳𝒚𝒏𝒄𝒉 *ੈ✩‧₊˚Joey is Shannon's older brother, and for her, her hero. We didn't get much of him, but I'm already looking forward to reading his books and his relationship with Aoife.

I have loved him with all my heart, he is Johnny's best friend and teammate in Tommen, the relationship between them is wonderful, there were a couple of times I cried from laughter with their conversations. Gibsie cares for Johnny even though he doesn't let himself be cared for, and also from Shannon since he knows how much she means to Johnny. I am very interested in his relationship with Claire and knowing that he is going to have his book makes me go AAAAAAAAAA!'Hail, rain or snow, Gibsie had my back'

And this is one of the reasons for my 5.✰ stars, I could feel the butterflies fluttering in my stomach the entire time, it was like feeling my first high school love again.'Jesus, this girl was beautiful.''I'd noticed it earlier of course, she had a striking look about her, but now, seeing her up close like this and being able to count the freckles on her face – eleven by the way – it was hitting home just how striking she was.'I don't want to delve too deeply into their relationship because apart from not being the main theme of the book, it is better that you see it for yourself when you read it.

"447","40944965","3.2 starsThe deal is.....The main couple was cute, the secondary characters were even better, many scenes were downright hilarious and many inexplicably sad, the writing was easy to follow and it was without a doubt one of the best high school romances I’ve ever read. But then we have info dumpy monologues, really long chapters, an even longer page count, unnecessary scenes that bored me to death, a bunch of convenient crashing into male chests, a heroine that unintentionally got on my nerves, zero character development, only one proper bloody kiss scene in an 887 page book and a love story that’s actually pretty average. There....I said it, bring out the pitchforks.PS; that hospital scene at the end? Yeaaa you know which one I’m talking about. That was possibly the funniest, cutest, most wholesome and my favourite fucking book scene ever.PS PS; who thought that cover was a good idea?",3
"448","40944965","4.5 ★'sThis book feels like a warm hug. Which might sound strange as it covers some heavy themes. For me it comes down to how genuine everything in this book is. It feels like life; real, a bit heartbreaking at times and the best when surrounded with people you love.✦“He added fresh bruises to old bruises.”✦This is a brutally honest depiction of that time between adulthood and childhood, of teenage love and friendships, not sugar-coating issues within families but also showing the strength that can be found there.Binding 13 is unique in the sense that the friendships and sibling relationships in this are just as good as the romance. At times I even loved Joey & Shannon's relationship more.Going into this I was a bit worried I wasn't gonna be able to connect to the characters as they are very young, and I usually prefer reading books with characters closer to my own age. That fear was quickly demolished. The writing is incredibly immersive. It was effortless to fall into this, feeling the struggles of being a teen stuck in difficult situations whilst also handling things such as crushes, grades and finding yourself.  ✧“Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart has ever been exposed to.”✧It's not fair to write a review on this book and not write about the romance. It's so clear to see that they are made for each other and you cannot help yourself from rooting for them from early on.It's that innocent type of teenage love that comes with butterflies and overthinking, but it still has such depth. Their mutual shy crushes made me feel all giddy as if I was the one with a crush. If someone dedicated She Will Be Loved to me, I would marry them on the spot. 😭✧“My heart. My poor, poor heart. I didn’t stand a chance with this boy.”✧The friendships in this has a dedicated place close to my heart. Gibsie and Johnny, Shannon, Lizzie and Claire. Not to be repetitive, but what I love about it is that it's so sincere and feels so real. Them being there for each other, knowing each other inside and out, relentless teasing and inside jokes, and just simply being comfortable in each other's company. This combined with the early 00's vibes gave off such an amazing ambiance throughout the book. (Being real for a second though, home-burned mix CD's is such a lost art. Spotify playlists just don't hit the same.🤧) Although the length of the book intimidated me initially, the pacing was perfect and had no real downtime which is very impressive for a book of over 800 pages. It went by much faster than I anticipated and I am extremely eager to continue this series going forward.______⌞pre-read:⌝I didn't think I would read this because I don't really get sports lol, but SK convinced me to give it a try. 🫶It's a bit intimidating going into this knowing how much people love it.

Binding 13 by Chloe Walsh2. I Hope This Doesn't Find You by Ann Liang3. People We Meet On Vacation by Emily Henry.but that's beyond the point of what i'm trying to state here.i was in a constant state of hypervigilance and anxiety since the start of the book. shannon's character hit too close to home, more than i was comfortable with. it was as if the fourth dimension broke and the world around me ceased to exist as i flipped the pages. i wasn't seeing shannon, i was seeing myself, and it fucking threw me in a state of an inexplainable paranoia.oh my god this book.my childhood hasn't been worse than shannon, but i still do find it relatable at some parts to some extent, but there's no denial in this, i love shannon lynch so fucking much! it's as if i have a little sister who unfortunately is tiptoeing around the same shards of glass in the same pattern that i somewhat once did in my life, and the urge to protect her was real. way too real considering these characters aren't even real.(p.s. idk why i feel the need to include this, but physically she and me are the same. word to word. it's so difficult to find such characters istg, she def boosted my confidence lol) joey and other kids. my god, joey lynch. my heart bleeds for him. the responsibilities and trauma he had to go through. far worse than anyone else. my heart mourns for these kids.idk i wanted to cry for the entire book. it made me so uncomfortable. i just wanna protect these characters alright??and GIBSIE. he's such a fucking tool but oh god i absolutely love him. my sunshine, my pookie pie, my haemoglobin, my cutie picapoo ugh claire you lucky luck woman.

Johnny Kavanagh. i hate this bleeding eejit. i hate him so much bcz he's so perfect and it makes me so soo mad cuz i didn't have a johnny to hold me in his arms while i cried my heart out. i never had a johnny to fight the world for me. i never had a johnny to appreciate my every scar, my every imperfection. i never had a johnny to fight my battles with me and protect me. i still don't. and you won't understand how much i crave such love. i need it so fucking much. i feel so... empty.
  ""Stay. Stay with me, Shannon. I can keep you safe. I'll look after you...""
i fell in love with johnny. literally. no i'm not being dramatic and no i'm not over exaggerating, but i wanted to rip him out of the book and keep by my side forever. in shannon like the river's words: i want him, period.if innocent love is the phrase then johnny and shannon are the entire book. pure unadultered love that knows no boundaries.""I think I love that girl.""""Well, who's this girl?""""She's a river,"" I sighed and closed my eyes.

It made me laugh, cry, frustrated the hell out of me, and made me freakin swoon. I was a mess. It’s just so cute, adorable, and relevant. I loved every single one of these characters. Every. Single. One. These characters are so real to me. I feel like I’m so overwhelmed and that my heart is going to burst when I think about them. The book is full of angst, real life issues, and alpha Irish guys.

"453","40944965","Ladies, Gentlemen, and Non-Binary Pals of Goodreads, may you be so kind as to donate whatever your noble self can so we can get Miss Chloe an editor? By doing so, you will be contributing to saving paper, valuable resources, and the reader's mental health as well as time. Thank you :)Before you proceed, I would like for you to understand that the following rant review contains a lot of swearing, incoherent rambling, and capitalized yelling. Reader discretion is advised. -- lol that was fun, but now:Seriously, one thing I absolutely hate, no matter what genre I'm reading is telling instead of showing. This had SO MUCH of telling, SO MUCH - LIKE PAGES WORTH OF - inner dialogue and FOR WHAT?! The book was written in dual pov, so for most of the book I just had to see them both mentally waxing poetry about how good the other person looks. AND THERE WAS SM BELLA CONTENT? Like fuck her, why did I have to read SO much about her, I really don't understand. And all the scenes she was in were 
  literally the same
In Johnny's case - he only started to grow on me in the chapter where he was out of his senses and didn't know what he was saying. That is when I liked him most. We're told he's extremely picky when it comes to the girls he surrounds himself with, while in reality, his last fuck-buddy is an obsessive stardom-crazy bitch, and the girl he ""falls"" for is a girl with ""lonesome"" eyes and a dysfunctional family. I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT MAN HAS A LONER SAD GIRL KINK. Every time he had to describe her, he would mention how she was lonesome, fragile, uncertain - like yeah, makes you believe he absolutely loves the girl, doesn't it? 🙃We're told that he sticks to his routine, nothing in his life is more important than rugby, and he will not lose sight of what is important to him. In his pov, during the never-ending inner monologue, he goes on and on about how he's not one of those guys who waste their time on drinking and pussies. No, he has more important shit to do. In reality, he ignores his training for Shannon, goes out to drink with Gibs whenever invited, gets multiple hard-ons for Shannon, and cannot stop seeking her out everywhere after only meeting her once . Yup, what a focused man. We're also told ample times that he hates lies when in reality, he tells multiple lies himself. Love me a hypocrite <3But I can ignore all this. What got to me most was his indecisiveness, and hot and cold behavior. He will think about how beautiful she is obsessively. He'll think about how much he likes her. He'll drop the l-bombs too - which they both do, as and when they wish, and then go back to the ""i don't even know you / we're friends"" bs - will give her multiple hints that he likes her because he'll always protect her whenever she's in trouble, go out of his way to give her multiple lifts home, share secrets about his injuries etc and then always center back to ""I cannot afford to do this,"" ""my career is on the line,"" ""i will go away so it'll only end up with both of us being hurt"" - and this repeated for like 800 pages, LIKE FOR FUCKS SAKE PICK A SIDE! The thing I liked about him though was how he always stood up Shannon, didn't get under anybody's influence, took good decisions even while drunk, and had a very cute dog. His morphine episode really made him extremely adorable and fun to read about, but we came back to good ol' johnny when he woke up from his drug-induced coma. ALSO, HEART EYES FOR HIS PARENTS!2018 me would've been on her knees for him though, given how protective he was. maybe i don't like him much bec the guy saves and protects the girl ALWAYS is not something i particularly enjoy reading now and that was what happened throughout the book.Moving on to Shannon, i'm going to try my best to get this across without coming across as a heartless bitch - I did not care about her. Yes, I felt bad about her situation. Yes, I wanted her to get out of her fucked up home. Yes, I disliked her parents. But her as a character, outside of that, fell super flat for me. I just don't understand how there was no character development in her when the book was 800+ pages long. Like somebody please explain it to me. Multiple times the abuse also felt like a plot device to me, because it was only shown on two occasions. One where her father finds the newspaper article and at the end. The last chapter left an impact on me, but I wished it had happened sooner, yk? Because throughout the book, most of the time, it's just Johnny noticing all her bruises, and then questioning her about them. Her anxiety after being bullied relentlessly was justified, but I like to see my characters try and fight that, instead of settling into that. Also, I get that not every fmc has to be a badass but I would've liked seeing her mental battles, her tending to her bruises, her thinking about what she's been through, and how she could fight for herself. And I got none of that.I like good slow burns as much as the next person, but there was absolutely no burn here for the major part of the book. I really was rooting for my babies Gibs and Claire more than the main couple. I'm salty about how little we got to see them, I NEED MORE! Everybody should have a best friend like Gibs, he was the highlight of the book for me. I absolutely love him  he even let that pedophile bitch suck his dick to get Shannon's file that johnny wanted, like 😭 But for shannon and johnny, they went from 0 to 100 real quick, and went back to 0 even faster. Their whole dynamic was equal parts confusing and frustrating to me, and again, they just told us that they love the other person, but we never got to see how did that happen, or when did that happen. Like there was no flow to it. he just likes that she's not like other girls and she likes that he's hot and cares for her 😭😭 I was also living for the Aoife crumbs we got, I already love her! The last chapter of this book was literally the most impactful one for me, and only for that is this book getting 3 stars. I really wish the whole book was like that, but I fucking hope keeping 13 does not disappoint me as much as this did. To, Lila and Lilyya i'm sorry my loves, i really wanted to enjoy this, but it was a miss for me 🥲 i'm not giving up on keeping 13 though, i still have some hope <3To, MUSKAAAN, I know I've said this multiple times, but I would've dnf-ed this without you. I only got the strength to see this to the end because I knew I could joke around with you about it!

Oh my dear heart!💓 I hestitated reading this book for the longest, simply because it was YA and I don't read a lot of it, especially YA romance. However, I am beyond happy that I finally decided to give this series a go. After seeing so many wonderful and heartfelt reviews, I went in with very high expectations. Usually, when I do that I end up dissapointed but not with this book. Binding 13 lived up to everything I read and heard. The character and relationship building in this book was simply PERFECTION!💕 I found myself emotionally connected to the characters, and their relationships with each other had my emotions everywhere...the love, the anger, the fear, the giddiness, the angst. I NEED AND WANT MORE OF IT!😍😘I can't wait to read the next one.

  “Keep pushing me, kid, and it won’t matter who you’re related to; you’ll be off this team. But go anywhere near that girl, and God himself won’t be able to save you.”

  ""I was an obsessive bastard by nature, with a one-track mind that was currently—and solely—programmed on her. I had to know more. I needed more.""

  ""It mattered that she was able to do this to me. It mattered that, hours later, I was still thinking about her, wondering about her, and inevitably worrying about her. It mattered that she mattered when no one ever mattered to me before.""

  ""And why wouldn’t my heart stop trying to beat its way out of my chest? Was this going to happen every time I bumped into him? If so, I needed to get a prescription.""

  ""There was nothing forgettable about the girl, and I found myself gravitating toward her, wanting to find her looking at me, and then growing frustrated when she didn’t. Knowing that I would listen to whatever she had to say, whenever she wanted to say it, regardless of time or inconvenience, was a frightening concept.""

  ""“Because I thought you were sweet,” Johnny shot back, and I didn’t have to look to know he was pouting. He’d been pouting for almost an hour. I snickered to myself. “Now I know better,” Johnny huffed. “You’re a little demon.”

  “Tell me who put their hands on you,” he coaxed as he stood behind me, my face in his hand and his fingers on my throat. “And I’ll make it better.”

  ""She was so fucking beautiful it was painful, with those big blue eyes staring back at me all innocent and full of uncertainty. I didn’t need the temptation that came with being this close to her. Problem was, every time she ran, I found myself chasing right after her, desperate to just be with her.""

  “Binding thirteen,” Gibsie snickered as he tore off way too fucking fast for comfort. “Little Shannon blew that shit clean out of the water.”

  ""I wanted to fight all her battles. I wanted to give her all her smiles and make her laugh and snatch her away from the rest of the world and keep her all to myself. I just wanted her. For keeps.""

  “What happened to being friends, Johnny?” Mam asked. “I lied,” I snickered. “I’ve been lying all along.” “Oh, Johnny,” Mam sighed. “You never had to lie, baby. I like that girl.” “She’s mine,” I grumbled. “You can’t have her.”
I could honestly go on and on but I have to get to the ""Keeping 13"" so I know what happens...please dont break my heart! Please don't dissapoint me!💔😭Pre-Read: It is finally time to jump into this series! It is all SK and Kendyl's fault🤣🤣Fingers crossed it lives up to the hype and my heart can handle it!🤞💖😘",5

    ”Hi Johnny.”“Hi Shannon.”Hey Siri play “You are in love” (Taylor’s version)
  
“One night, he wakesStrange look on his facePauses, he says‘Your my best friend’And you knew what it wasHe is in love”Welcome back to a brand-new review! I’m so excited to tell you about this book because I loved it so so much. First of all, I have to point out that you don’t have to be scared by the length of the book because—even tho it has almost 800 pages—the writing is captivating, and you don’t get bored. Holy mother of God I was so invested in these teenager dramas, it’s embarrassing…👀About the plot:This book tells the story of Johnny—a 17-year-old popular boy whose life turns around rugby and nothing else: no girl, no injury, no friend, no one can interfere in his dream, not even his parents. But something is about to change when he meets Shannon—a little girl, too young, too fragile, too damaged for him, but nothing is going to stop them to fall for each other. My thoughts (spoilers ahead):As I’ve already said, I fell in love with this book, even tho the story is about two teenagers who fall in love with each other. It’s very long but nothing stopped me to read 100 and more pages per day and I loved every single page of it. The story is captivating, a lot happens, and this makes you so invested that you can’t stop reading it. The writing is simple and since the author is Irish, she put a glossary and the pronunciation of names you’ll find within. So don’t worry if you don’t understand or you don’t know some words, the glossary has them all, which I appreciate a lot since English—let alone Irish— is not my first language. I laughed, I cried, I got mad, and I felt pain but it was all worth it. Be ready because it's a journey...!!TW!! If you’re sensible to violence, please skip this part.Shannon: I need to present her a little before telling you what I think about Shannon like the river. So, she is a 15-year-old girl, who lives with her parents and brothers. Joey—her older brother—is her anchor and I really appreciated the bond between them; they were fond of and protected each other. Shannon hasn’t an easy life: she’s been bullied since she started going to school by her classmates and she’s also been beaten up by her own father, who was an alcoholic. The situation got too far that her mother decided to make her change school by going to a private one, even tho the family wasn’t rich. This is where she met Johnny. On her first day of school he knocked her off during rugby, but he took really good care of her. From that moment, they were inseparable. Johnny took every chance he got to spend time with her, and soon they started falling for each other. Shannon is a very fragile person, with a lot of traumas caused by people in school and her own parents. She’s been through a lot and I wanted to hug her during the entire book. I’m so glad she found Johnny because she deserves happiness, but mostly she deserves to feel safe around people which is something we take for granted—at least most of us— because we feel safe in our home and we should feel safe. I know that’s not something every family has the privilege to experience, and it makes my heart break. I felt the pain Shannon felt, as well as the moment of happiness, sadness and fear she passed through. I had the need to protect her and I can easily understand why Johnny felt that too. The end made me cry my eyes out and my heart broke in thousands of pieces. I hope that in the second book she’ll have her safety feeling she desperately needs. “Family line” by Conan Gray reminds me of her.Johnny: I loved him so so much. Even tho he’s only 17, he’s very mature. He’s a really good guy, thoughtful, loyal to his promises, brave and kind. He def has an easy life: he has the money, the status, the rugby, a loving family, girls, good grades...He was very fond of Shannon tho, since the first day he met her, he didn’t even hesitate to step in and help her when she most needed someone to take care of her. He didn't judge her. Never. He also was very respectful with women and girls, not only with Shannon. As I said before, his life turns around rugby. That is his dream. However, he got injured and he had to have a delicate surgery. He was struggling because of pain but it didn’t stop him to chase his dream. I really admire his strength and his courage, tho I think he put himself in a very dangerous position. He's the sweetest guy without being too much. I have really few things to complain about: 1) the fact that it took too much time for him to realize his love for Shannon. Like dude wake the hell up!!! 2) He kept complaining about her age when he was literally 17 and she was 15—and in the middle of the book she turns 16, soooooo… I don’t find the age gap a big deal, I bet everyone in high school had a crush or dated someone older by 2 years or so. Again, not a big deal. But he kept saying that it was��in fact– a big problem. Eventually he got over this bullshit, thank Lord. 3) he didn’t kiss her back the first time she kissed him…Anyway, EVERYONE LISTEN CAREFULLY: HE HAD A PLAYLIST ON HIS IPOD FULL OF LOVE SONGS WITH HER NAME!!!!!!! He made her a freaking playlist with love songs. Like, if someone makes me a playlist with love songs is over for me, I fall in love immediately. Their relationship: I freaking loved every second of it. The most beautiful thing was that they were friends before being lovers. They supported each other, they wanted to spend every second together, she felt safe with him, and he protected her always. I loved the little things happened between them, like hands touching and so on. Also, the end was so touching. The fact that he kept telling his parents that she was the one… AHHHH!!! Just perfect. Really. Do I recommend this book? Absolutely YES. If you like teenager dramas and cute love stories, this book is for you but be careful and read the TWs first!Some quotes:
  
    “""Because you're beautiful,"" […]A boy had never called me beautiful before.Not like this.Not with such forwardness.Not with such sincerity.Johnny said it, though, and my heart was flapping around in my chest like a demented, caged bird, fighting to escape.[…]“Inside and out”[…]""Everywhere.””“If feelings were objects, then I was teetering on the edge of a great precipice, and if girls were weapons, then Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart had ever been exposed to.”“But I already felt like I was drowning with her.That's how consumed I was in this girl.That's how much I loved her.”“""She makes my heart go, like, whoa.""""So bad, Da,"" I sighed. ""Boom, boom, fucking boom."" I shook my head. ""All the time.""[…]And then I heard those two words.""Hi, Johnny.""""Boom, boom, fucking boom. Da,"" I groaned, slapping a hand against my chest ""I'm done for.""”“And those fucking midnight blue eyes - which I didn't think was a good enough word to describe the color.They should have been called soul blue because they were deep as fuck and sucked a person right in…”“Instead, I nestled my cheek against his side and closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift off to sleep without an ounce of fear in my heart because it couldn't exist inside of me, not when this boy had his arm around me.”

 -`♡´-3 Stars- I'm undecided on this rating a little bit so I may change it again but I'm going with 3 for now.So let me start with- I was under the impression that this was a YA sports romance initially. I understood that there was family drama and physical abuse the the FMC was experiencing at home but I've read YA that includes heavy topics and this ...where on earth did I get YA from???Fair warning - this is definitely not a YA story and even though I've read plenty of books with violence in them, some of the abuse scenes in this even had me an adult drawing back in horror. I adore Johnny, he is the epitome of a lovable and protective love interest. The way he treated Shannon right from the beginning was so heartwarming and really had the emotions in me stirring.Add the horrible things that Shannon is going through at home with her alcoholic and abusive father along with her dipshit of a mother who is such a weak woman that she basically turns her head to the physical and emotional abuse being inflicted on all of her children - it makes for a compelling plot.╰┈➤ Where my issues with the book come in- is in the writing and storytelling itself. I really had to look past quite a lot of things. I know I've said it many times in my updates, but trust me - it's no where near the amount of times it's mentioned in the book.╰┈➤ 
   Shannon is tiny. She's SMOL. She's petite. She's pint sized. She's tiny...tiny...tiny.
 Oh, we get it Chloe. We got it. I just want to understand how can a 5 ft girl not get up on a stool? I'm only 4 inches taller and?? I've never felt like the size of a toddler - lmao. But for real.Not only that but the amount of clumsiness and things that happen really just made her seem even younger than she was made me feel a little uncomfortable. In a way that she seemed childlike? ╰┈➤ The whole 'pitching a tent' scene. I really had second hand embarrassment and some of the ick with the way things went down with them in that scene.Overall, I did enjoy the story itself and it did evoke emotions out of me. I've already got book 2 checked out from the library.",3
"457","40944965","i finished this 800+ page beast in less than 24 hours on to book 2",3
"458","40944965","This is THE most FRUSTRATING book I have read this year. -The plot goes round and round in circles, repeating itself every other chapter. For example: plot happens in chapter 3...chapters 4 and 5 revolve around Shannon and Johnny relaying said plot in chapter 3 to their friends. NOTHING HAPPENS. It's like 1 step forward and two steps in place. I can literally skip entire chapters and still get the gist of what happens. By like the 40% point, the two main characters have had hardly any interaction- but I know all of the antics of their friends really well! Gibsie is hilarious! Lizzie is a drag. That Rowen character sucks. Gibsie and Claire sooo belong together and are blind to it (I sense the build up to their own book)...etc. The book mostly revolves around Shannon's shitty home life and school life, Johnny's sports and their friends. Which is all fine...except its more about all of those things than a romance. And it doesn't help that so much of the plot is repeated every other chapter. -There is slow burn romance....and then there is so slow, they literally go backwards- romance. The main characters have maybe 5/6 worthwhile scenes together and I am at the 72% mark. They talk the day Johnny hit Shannon in the head with a ball, they talk maybe once at lunch, they talk when she is forced to go over to his house twice, they have one meaningful conversation in his car and they go to a pub together. But most of their conversations revolve around him trying to figure out what the marks on her body are from, and kicking the asses of those who threaten her. They have kissed once (one sided mind you), talked a handful of times, yet they both feel like they are in love with the other. HOW?-I get Shannon is a wounded bird- but MAN her actions are frustrating to read. She's just SO meek and the ultimate damsel that needs saving. Everything bad that could happen to her, happens to her. It's just a lot. And I get that she has had a hard life, but sometimes I just really wanted her to stand up and become a strong person despite all of that.-Although I am giving this a one star out of pure frustration with the plot-I do have to say that the dialogue is this book is fantastic and it is pretty well written in general.",1
"459","48763676","4 1/2 stars ⭐️ Great story, would have received 5 stars, but needs some cleaning up from typo errors. Other than that I really enjoyed the interaction between Raxtor and Mina. These alien males are true Alphas, they live to fight. Love is a foreign concept to them. Plenty of action is sure to follow in their wake. This is a standalone, but to get the greatest enjoyment the books should be read in order to follow the underlying storyline.",4
"460","48763676","Well written and adventurous, lovely characters and a good paced storyline - very entertaining Still I haven’t found the dark way n this romance there are still some errors where the name of our hero was falsely switched with his opponent - that’s irritated me a bit and slowed down the reading. Nevertheless nice adventure in a interesting setting.",4

"462","48763676","I received this book as a gift of an advance reading copy. Now that I have finished it I would like to give an honest opinion of what I read.This book has everything it just like the other books that I have read by Athena Storm, but I have to admit this is the first time reading something co-authored by Tara Starr. There is drama, romance, suspense, and battle fighting action. There is only one problem that I had with the book, a problem that could have been solved by better proof reading. That problem being that there is a mix up several times between our hero Raxtar, and the evil villain District Chief Udrak. It did stop the flow of the story as I had to stop and say wait what is going on here. That was the only problem that I had with the story. Other that I would recommend reading this one just because it is a serious page turner.Mina Tower is auctioned off the meanest, cruelest, evil Kraaj there ever was. Just the way that he looks is terrifying enough. Raxtar is one of his enforcers call the Black Star. Everything on him including his cap is black. He is assigned to take Mina back to Udrak’s quarters.Mina has other plans and during the flight over she manages to get a weapon and ends up crashing the shuttle that they are in. She would have died in the crash but for some reason Raxtar throws his body over her. When he wakes the shuttle is on fire and he has been pulled away from it. Even though she has left Mina had saved his life. Now he must find her or his life will be forfeited by the District Chief Udrak.He does find her and being with her changes something within him. Something that he has been feeling for sometime now. He and Mina stay together and now they are wanted criminals. Will they survive to live through this or will Udrak win get Mina to do the terrible things he wants and kill Raxtar in the process. There are so many things that happen in this story and the best way to explain it is just to say read the story you will not be disappointed.",5
"463","48763676","I absolutely enjoyed reading this Athenaverse Collaboration written by two very talented authors & found this dark Sci-Fi alien romance quite fascinating to read. The well-written & adventurous plot holds the reader’s attention until the end. The characters are well-developed & interesting with strong-willed personalities, one of the characters (a human female, Mina) displays extreme defiance & tries to escape while another character (a rather brutal Kraaj warrior, Raxtor) is starting to have doubts & is beginning to sympathize with her situation.There is: a pending Coalition invasion, Alliances, Councils, smugglers, intrigue, twists & turns, intrigue, adventure, action, abduction, various kinds of aliens, humans, an auction, danger, threats, enemies, defiance, attempted escape, violence, conflict, determination, despondency, doubts, strange attractions, compromises, memories, decisions, declarations, recaptured, devious plans, unexpected surprises, deadly confrontations, declarations, love, contentment, some steam & a happy conclusion for this couple, there is a intriguing epilogue that will continue in the next book of this series & I am looking forward to it with great anticipation.",4
"464","48763676","Another great story of the characters in Athenaverse. This is the story of Raxtar a Kraaj soldier who is working under District 17 Chief Udrak, and Mina a women sold as a companion.

"465","48763676","I've only just started reading SciFi romance and wasn't sure I would like this. But it was a total surprise! This is set an a world that is being fought over by the Coalition and the Kraaj. But an evil leader is turning humans into slaves. It's up to Raxtar to save one human from being enslaved by his boss. Against all common sense, he turns his back on his leader knowing he will be hunted and killed. What I liked about this story was the author's ability to make this world come alive, something hard to do on a planet other than Earth. The descriptions and action were delightful. But this is a romance after all, so the descriptions of the budding relationship between Mina and Raxtar was even better! I loved how she refused to cower to the Kraaj even from where she was being sold as a slave. I just love tough heroines!Overall, great story. And one that would convince me to read more SciFi Romance.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",5
"466","48763676","Seems that human females had become a covet item for the Kraaj. After being abducted, Mina was ready to fight tooth and nail for her freedom but found she was not alone in her fight. Raxtar was a brutal, massive and fearsome Kraaj warrior, but when recognized who Mina was, he knew what he had to do, no matter how. Exciting descriptions detailing Raxtar's fierceness, his immense strength and the passion he felt. But his protectiveness for his woman surpassed everything expected. Mighty man! But smart, fierce, determined and passionate Mina was not left behind. A plot development full of action, suspense, violence, evil characters, cunning situations, romance and passion. A HEA was not enough for these strong characters so the end the end of the story alerts us to the war that is about to begin. Interesting, entertaining and passionate story that I enjoyed.",5

The main characters falling for each other could be a death sentence for them both. But if I had to risk it all for someone, it would be for someone like Raxtar.

This was a page-turner and has quite a bit of action as the leads are on the run through most of the book, and things happen very early in the story. The Kraaj main character quickly becomes protective of his human mate, so there is that protective alpha male who will do anything for his mate aspect to the story.

  Zodiac Academy Guide – Read or Not to Read?
PRO:Because there are two main couples in this series, you’ll find at least ONE couple you want to root for. One couple is soft and forbidden while the other is toxic and angsty. There is definitely something for everyone. Best case scenario you’ll love them both.CON:Because there are two main couples in this series, the chances can also be high that you’ll find ONE couple extremely frustrating/annoying/boring. From what I’ve observe, everyone got that one couple they are reading this series for, while they feel kinda meh or alright about the other one.What to expect when reading ZA:➷ one of the most supportive & wholesome sibling bonds, sisters who would do anything for each other! Darcy & Tory are the opposite but there is no rivalry and they complement each other so well➷ bromances that make you wish you had a dick to be included in the club➷ characters you’ll loathe at first, but learn to love➷ character development, this point is pretty much connected to the previous one, but needed to be said➷ enemies that become family!! you can't see the vision in the first book yet and even if book 1 isn't for you bc of the bullying aspect, I'd tell you to keep going until at least book 2 and 3. ➷ rollercoaster of emotions that make you want to flush your e-reader down the toilet or smash your phone against a wall, your pick➷ THE MOST AMAZING ROMANCES➷ do you like drugs? yes? cause this series has CRACK in itWhat not to expect when reading ZA:➷ beautiful and eloquent writing, the writing is rather immature and wattpadish➷ humor that is for everyone .. i’m only saying Faes using Faebook and driving Faerarris #faentastic➷ fast paced plot, this series is 100% character and relationship driven

  SONG:
 Chung Ha - Gotta GoI missed my chance of going to a magical school, because I'm not an orphan & the chosen one. So I'm just here trying to live vicariously through these characters living their best life by learning mind coercion, water-bending etc. 😭🤚So far my impression is that 
  Zodiac Academy
 is a mix between Harry Potter, Winx Club and Avatar the last Airbender, but on steroids. 😂════ ⋆★⋆ ════➵ 
  PLOT
════ ⋆★⋆ ════Zodiac Academy is written in dual POV of Tory and Darcy Vega. The twins are living in the mortal world on their own, after their last guardian threw them out when they turned 18. One day Professor Orion turns up–while the girls struggle to come up with money to pay their rent–and tells them that they are Fae born and have magic in their veins. It turns out that Tory and Darcy's parents were the last King and Queen of Solaria and the Vega twins have to return to Solaria to graduate from Zodiac Academy to reclaim their throne. Through the Awakening, Darcy and Tory find out that they both hold every element (Fire, Water, Air & Earth), when it's only common to have two or three elements. The plot of Zodiac Academy: The Awakening is pretty basic. Darcy and Tory are going to the Academy, going from one class to the next trying to survive and learn as much about the new world they have been thrust into. There are the mean girls, the bullies, the royalty fan-club, the weird/creepy as hell professors, magical creatues... they have to deal with all kind of characters and it's not easy. Not having any prior knowledge of the world and magic around them, makes the twins easy prey for everyone. Darcy and Tory get bullied and humiliated a lot in the first few days at school and I wanted to reach into the book and sucker punch a lot of characters. But their worst enemies are the four Heirs (Caleb, Darius, Max & Seth) who want them gone. I'll get to the Heirs more later on. The main plot is the Vega twins navigating their day to day life at Zodiac Academy, but there a strnage things that keeps happening and they learn that they live in darker times than they thought, so it's going to be interesting to see what will happen in the next six books. I feel the need to say that the romance only plays a secondary role in this book. We get a teaser of potential pairings, but nothing is really established. But I already love & see the potential of both the sisters love interest and the slowburn enemies-to-lovers they have going for them. 💫════ ⋆★⋆ ════➵ 
  WORLD BUILDING
════ ⋆★⋆ ════After the demise of the King and Queen of Solaria, the power was split between four families, the Celestial Heirs who share the power of the throne equally. Zodiac Academy is divided into four Houses where the four Heirs are the House CaptainsHouse Aqua 🌊 ➵ Max RigelHouse Terra 🌱 ➵ Caleb AltairHouse Ignis 🔥 ➵ Darius AcruxHouse Aer 🌪️ ➵ Seth Capella Every fae belongs to an OrderTAENIA ° (Parasitic Orders)➵ Vampire (Orion, Caleb)➵ Siren (Max)MUTATIO ° (Mutating Orders)➵ Dragon (Darius)➵ Werwolf (Seth)➵ Manticore➵ Griffin➵ Cerberus➵ Pegasus➵ Nemean Lion➵ Hydra➵ Caucasian Eagle➵ ChimeraDIVISUS ° (Spliced Orders)➵ Minotaur➵ Medusa➵ Centaur➵ Cyclops➵ Spinx➵ HarpyEverything is pretty straighforward. It's a lot of names for the different Orders, but not all of them appear in this book, there is no info-dump or at least, IMO it's pretty easy to follow. After reading the Blood and Ash series, every fantasy series that follows is mindblowingly easy to understand tbh. 😂
  ""Everything in Solaria is about power, Miss Vega. Don't forget that. Everyone takes what they want. It's our way. And if you don't start taking it yourself, you're going to fail at this Academy before you've even attempted to pass The Reckoning.""

  CHARACTERS
════ ⋆★⋆ ════↠ THE VEGA TWINS.
  (left: Darcy; right: Tory)credits to @jessdraw.s Just from this book alone, Tory is the twin that I like more, because she's the kind of heroine I usually go for. Bold. Fearless. Doesn't back down. Not afraid to open her mouth. Whereas, Darcy is the softer sister who is more kind-hearted, more naive and less in-your-face. I really have a soft spot for characters like Tory, because she's always the one to throw herself in front of danger to protect her sister. What makes me super happy about this happy is that there is NO sibling rivalry between Darcy and Tory. They have a great relationship and very protective of each other. While I prefer Tory at this moment, I have a feeling this is going to change soon when the romance part comes into play more. I already ship 
  Darcy + Professor Orion
 so hard in this book, even though they have not that many scenes together and haven't even kissed yet. But the enemies-to-lovers, forbidden romance they have going on for them? YES, I'M SOLD. 
  I lifted my chin and the air became thick between us. ""One day, Professor, I'm going to be strong enough to fight you off.""He took a measured breath and I felt like he was sucking something vital out of my body that I wasn't sure I'd ever get back. ""I know,"" his eyes glittering. ""But until that day, you're mine, Blue.""
Tory seems to be in this love triangle between Caleb and Darius and I think Tory's romance is going to be so much more frustrating to read. Personally, I prefer 
  Tory's dynamic with Darius
, because they have a more explosive chemistry, while her scenes with Caleb don't do anything for me. But after reading the ending of this book which was hard and vicious, I don't know how either of the boys will redeem themselves. Right now, I think Tory deserves better, cuz what they did was cruel and yo bye get out of my face & burn in hell. 
  Tears never did anyone any favours, but sometimes they just needed to fall.
↠ PROFESSOR LANCE ORION. 
  credits to @jessdraw.s I SWEAR TO EVERYTHING HOLY HOW I CAN'T STAND THIS GUY. He keeps laughing at his own jokes/puns, even though they are so bad and I can't. I hate him so much. 😂 And his dimple doesn't do ANYTHING for me AT ALL. Yup, I sound very convincing. Orion gives me so many ""I hate everyone, but you vibes"" and I love it. He is so moody. Every time I read a scene about Orion teaching, I'm laughing my ass off, cause he's always doing something like banging students head on the desk to make me laugh (there is something wrong with me ik 🤷🏽‍♀️). He's an asshole to Darcy and Tory too, but it's so entertaining. So far he's my favorite character. 
  ""Miss Vega if you're not standing up in the next three seconds, you're going to regret it,"" Orion barked. ""Which Vega?"" Tory asked, barely concealing her jibing tone. Orion's eyes snapped to her. ""The one who has tried to individualise herself by dying the ends of her hair blue. It has failed by the way.""
(he means Darcy lmao)
  ""Oh come on Professor as if you don't love having a bunch of girls drooling over you,"" Tyler called out from the front row, shoving a hand into his blonde-tipped hair to mess it up.Orion rose from his seat, wandeirng casually towards the boy with a smile that said he was thoroughly amused. The guy grinned from ear to ear as Orion reached out to him. In a surge of movement, he cracked Tyler's head against his desk and the entiere class inhaled as his smile fell away.
he is so hoooot!! 🥵↠ THE HEIRS. 
  (from left to right: Seth, Caleb, Darius & Maxcredits to @witchlingsart All four Heirs are grade A assholes. They try everything in their power to make Tory and Darcy's stay at Zodiac Academy hell and want to expel them. The Heirs bring the bullying to a new level, it's not only extremely humaliating for the twins, but dangerous too. The four guys have been trained their whole life to rule over Solaria and then here come two girls from the mortal world trying to take their throne. Having read Darius backstory in #0.5, I'm biased towards him out of all the Heirs, cause he has shitty parents and is under alot of pressure and out of the group he's the tall, dark and handsome one, what is there not to love. But after what they did to Tory I'M FUMING and they are on the top of my shit-list. Idk what's going to happen in the next several books, but it will take me a while to not hate them anymore, if that's even possible. ════ ⋆★⋆ ════➵ 
  I ENJOYED IT A LOT, BUT WHY I'M STILL GIVING IT 3.5 STARS
════ ⋆★⋆ ════I've read the #0.5 prequel book before where we see a little of Darius and Orion's backstory. That novella was fast-paced plotwise that I expected every book in this seres to be that way. Instead this book was very slow and felt like a very long prologue to the story, cause not much is happening besides Darcy and Tory going to classes. I didn't it, because I enjoy that kind of content with academia books where the protagonists takes time to get to know their surrounding & the authors took the time for the twins to settle in. It's more a hint for people who still want to read the series to keep their expectations low, because this book is not action packed. The lenght of this series is probably holding a lot of people off too, does this book had to be almost 500+ pages? Probably not, but it didn't feel that long to me and enjoyed most of it. 🤷🏽‍♀️This is just the first book. There are still six more books to come, so I see a lot of potential for improvement. And I don't mean that the book is so bad that it needs so many changes, but more the fact that Tory and Darcy are still newbies in Solaria. They still have a lot of room for character development, to controll their power + make alliances with other people. Now it feels like the it's the twins against the WHOLE world and Darcy and Tory had to take hits after hits and it's depressing. The only solid relationship I see is the bond the twins have with each other and I can't wait to see all the romantic relationships established, maybe form friendships with some of the other people in the Academy, the twins kicking ass and take what is rightfully theirs. I'm excited to read the rest of the series, because I feel it's going to get so much better and I just need more of Darcy & Orion. <3┍━━━━━━━━━━━━━┑

"490","46261182","Before I say anything and get into spoilers, I want to put a big *trigger warning* out there for this book: NON-CON (non-consensual acts) GALORE! No one mentioned this anywhere (not in the reviews, or in the summary, anything). Beware! I picked this book up because I saw the author post a tiktok comparing it to a steamy, adult Harry Potter. Well, I really like all those words. I also really like astrology, and the reviews here on GoodReads are generally good. Y’all led me astray. This book is literally the two main characters being violated emotionally, physically and sexually over and over for the entire run time of book. There are basically no other plot elements other than the next abuse that the Vega Twins have to suffer through at the hands of these evil men. Without knowing this going in, this book was shocking to me from beginning to end in the vile content that it was constantly spewing at me. The actions that the “”romantic interests”” take in this book are not just dubious consent, but nonconsensual in the text. The main characters will literally tell them: “No please don’t do that” / “No please stop” / “No please, leave me alone” and they never do! Y’all are in the reviews here saying “bully romance” this “bully romance” that, I’m not here to yuck anyone’s yum, but the actions of these characters without knowledge of the tropes of the genre are abusive and disgusting. I feel like they’re trying to establish a low point so that once the girls are strong enough to fight back (point to note: the girls literally become resigned to the abuse about 3/4 of the way into the book, just accepting that this how they should be treated until they’re strong enough to stop it. No one deserves to be treated like this.), it’s a glorious moment or whatever. But Jesus Christ is it painful to read. I’m also not going to be read, what, two or three full length books full of abuse for one girl boss moment? (Also spoilers here but I really don’t care: the climax of this book brought tears to my eyes for how horrible it is to these girls. Seth cutting her hair, and then them just almost fully drowning the other one? This isn’t sexy and fun? I’m down for some bad boy stuff or like banter but like ? Attempted murder? If I were going to continue this series, I would literally never forgive these fucking assholes? I would want them dead? Comment below if you’re a mega fan and let me know if Tory and Darcy kill these evil men.)Harry Potter is obviously a huge inspiration here. One of the things that made and makes HP so inviting to readers is the world building and sense of escapism that the books foster. 1) The world building in this book is....shallow at best, laughable at worst. 2) These character’s lives are a living nightmare so the escapism factor is a big fat zero. They literally have almost no fun or ever feel any happiness. No one is at this place to help them. Why would I want to be there?Here’s some nitpicky stuff (spoilers ahead):-The author(s) are obviously not American, but our main characters are supposed to be from Chicago. They could not be bothered to use the American spellings of words and even use a bunch of British slang which is like ? Very silly ? -Kind of along with this, why does Diego have to use one random Spanish word a sentence? It feels like a cheap caricature to me (Oh, also if you’re a mega fan and reading this is Diego a nymph or is that just extremely heavy handed misdirection?)-The amount of times the characters “snarl” is comical. How do you even “snarl”?-The world building of the fae and the different orders feels like a way to justify non-con stuff. It feels like the authors wanted the non-con stuff in there and then wrote the orders to justify the actions.-The names of the professors are so stupid, lmao. Like people have names. They aren’t always hyper-specific to the role you want them to play in your book. It seems ridiculous that they all have names directly relating to the element they teach when we know that every other character just has a normal ass name.-One thing I do want to say, is that I actually really liked Tory and Darcy. But there is not one other likable character in this. Everyone else is either the literal scum of the earth, or just annoying (Tory and Darcy have two (2) friends, one of which is revealed halfway through the book to be lying to them (still don’t know which one yet, but I’m sure there’s a reveal coming up in another book) which is so silly.)-Literally who is who? Having two main characters that are twins and then five “romantic interests”, I couldn’t keep anyone straight until like 1/2 way through. Also the fact that each main character has two love interests? Why? What was the reason?-Orion (the professor) feeding on Darcy non-consensually feels like especially icky to me. Literally by the book abuse. Are there no rules at this school?-If there are no rules at this school, can the girls just kill these MF’s?I think that’s it. My big takeaway is that this book is presenting a very, very niche thing that, if you’re into it, can be great (I guess). But it should be more up front about that fact, because if you’re not into it, it is fucking horrible. From start to finish.",1
"491","46261182","I had to abandon this book after about 25%. I’m not into rape culture. Consent is sexy.",1
"492","46261182","a super mixed bag but i'm pretty invested! thoughts to come in a fantasy romance reading vlog",3
"493","46261182","“Why do I have such terrible taste in men?” Iv never related to anything this bad 😭💀I LOVED THIS BOOK HELLOO TAKE ALL OF MY MONEY IT MADE ME FEEL EMOTIONS THAT I NEVER KNEW EXISTED. TO ALL OF MY GIRLIES THAT RECOMMENED ME THIS I LOVE YOUUU BUT GOD WAS THAT PAINFUL I DON’T LIKE BULLY ROMANCES BUT I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE SOO UNFAIR TO GIVE THIS A LOWER RATING BECAUSE OF THE BULYYING BECAUSE ITS LITERALLY A BULLY ROMANCE FANTASY BOOK.LIKE IMAGINE GOING TO A BAR AND SAYING WHYS THERE SOO MUCH ALCOHOL 💀😭 The Orphaned vega twins had their lives turned upside down in one night. It all started when Tory vega was stopped by a stranger at the bar who followed her back to her apartment. Now this was no stranger it was Lance Orion a professor at the zodiac academy. Where he broke the news to girls that’s they’re not human but fae and that their real parents were the king and Queen of Solaria who were murdered but before the supposed attack their mother had swapped the twins with some human twins. Now as the only living heirs to the throne they must return to solaria attend zodiac academy to inherit the fortunes left behind. The girls reluctantly agree to go with Orion as they pretty much have no choice because they’r just broke teenage girls fending for them selves and if attending some magic school was going to sort that then why not  “Last chance, Roxy. Take your sister and leave this Academy. Go back to your little mortal lives and leave Solaria in the hands of people who are worthy of the throne,” he said darkly.”That’s where they thought wrong. As they arrive at zodiac academy they realise they aren’t welcome due to their run in with the 4 celestial heirs who were set to rule solaria together Max Rigil , Caleb Altair, Darius Acrux and Seth Capella. The twins return makes them feel threatened as not only do the twins contain the power of the 4 elements they are the true heirs to the throne the throne that they were all promised. Now having the 4 horsemen as your enemies wasn’t really on the agenda but HEYY WE WOULDN’T HAVE A PLOT IF THEY GOT ALONG😭 Tory Vega“Tears prickled the backs of my eyes but I bitch-slapped them down hard. I would not cry in front of this goddamn bastard.” Tory has my heart she is definitely my favourite twin not that I don’t love Darcy. Tory was a badass and made it bearable for me to read the bullying because hey that girl never backed down from a fight and totally gave me me vibes with her choice of men and the fact that she doesn’t cry infront of people that’s totally meee .EVEN AT THE END MY LOVE DIDN’T LET THEM GET THE BEST OF HER😭 Darcy Vega“I'd always had a thing for older guys and that coupled with the fact that Orion had the sort of face that made me forget to blink” She was so real for that Darcy wasn’t a pushover either she was Strong and stood her ground but she was just softer than Tory and wouldn’t put her self in stupid situations on purpose unlike her twin let’s just say she was the PRACTICAL TWIN.MY BABY WENT THROUGH SOO MUCH AND HER BLUEE HAIR IM IN LITERAL TEARS Lance Orion “Careful Miss Vega expressions like that are punishable in my classroom.”“Evening,” a deep voice murmured in my ear and I didn't have to look up to know who it was.” FULLY FOLDEDLANCE FRICKING ORION STOLE MY HEART FROM THE START. He was just perfect with the rude and blunt exterior and helloooo his humour had me rolling. The fact that he was a vampire totally bumped him up the ranks for me. HE IS A LIBRA THE CHERRY ON TOP WE SHARE THE SAME STAR SIGN IM TELLING YOU GUYS ITS MEANT TO BE😭😫 I DONT EVEN BELIEVE IN STAR SIGNS BUT A WIN IS A WIN  Darius Arcux “He was power and heat and war wrapped up in a single being. He’d fight to the death to maintain what was his”Darius is the guy that everyone wants he’s handsome toxic and powerful. I Don’t blame Tory for wanting him because heyy we’re all DELULU HERE. His friendship with the boys was cute the way he let Max feed on his energy willingly and would have let Caleb too if he wanted showed that he does have a soft spot. I hated him for the initiation test he put Tory through it was humiliating and degrading BUT I HATED HIM MORE AT THE END WHAT HE DID WAS NOT OKKKK IM STILL CRYING Caleb Altair “She's my Source. Touch her again and you're dead. Professor or not.” If I had a soft spot for anyone it was Caleb at the start when he pinned Tory and drained her blood I can’t lie I FULLY FREAKED OUT but he’s a vampire which totally makes sense my guy treated her as his favourite CapriSun the way he went bat shit crazy at Lance for feeding from her has me wondering what happened in the past that they hate each other. I thought him and Tory could have been a thing because no one can tell me he didn’t have little soft spot for her even at the end there was a small spot of humanity I felt it the way he looked at her it’s almost as if he felt guilty #FORVERADELULU 🥲 Seth Capella“You didn't just ignore me did you, babe?” Seth dropped into the seat beside mine, wrapping his arm around my waist and sending a bolt of electricity through my heart.” My little wolfy he was sooo funny he had me howling PUN INTENDED. He had his cute moments every time he called Darcy babe made my heart flutter. At First like the twins I thought he was the sweetest I THOUGHT WRONG I WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU A PART OF ME LOVED YOU SETH. Max Rigil“And besides, you spend enough of your time terrorising the other students at Zodiac to get your fix, Mr Rigel. You don't need to get it here every week too.” “For fuck's sake,” Max growled.” I cant lie we didn’t see Max much and when we did he was being an absolute prick. All I have for you is that he is that he is a siren who feeds off people’s emotions and he captains the house Aqua .ITS ALL HIS FAULT I HOPE SOMEONE GETS HIM IF IT WASN’T FOR HIM I WOULDN’T BE HEART BROKEN WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID My most memorable moment :  “What if we call a truce on our issues? For one night only,” he offered.”“I’ll even promise not to bite you tonight if you want?” HOW CONSIDERATE OF YOU CALEB 😭😭😭My favourite part from the whole book has to be the when the girls went dancing. I feel like it was the most wholesome scene the way everyone let their guard down and it was like group of teenage friends enjoying one another’s company NO TRICKS, BULLYING OR MIXED SIGNALS. Even though I ship Lance and Darcy I was loving Seth and Darcy too the way he was breaking down her walls was adorable PLEASEE I KNOW WHAT HE DOES LETS NOT TALK ABOUT IT STILL IN A PUDDLE OF TEARS. Love how Darius willingly went up to dance with Torry hands around her waist and all not willing to let go a part of me ALL OF ME was blushing and he was soo pissed when lance called him out only for Tory to carry on dancing with Calebb we love herrr 😍😍 Lance and Darcy are sooo cute the way he calls her “Blue” that nickname is to diee for. GUYS I KNOW HE IS HER TEACHER BUT HE’S 25 and SHE'S 18 AND ISN’T A MINOR Some of my favourite moments: “And screwing him didn't bring out the wolf in you either?” SOMEONES JEALOUS1. At the start when he claimed her to be his personal juice box only so no other vampire including Caleb could feed from her or touch her because lets be honest he didn’t want to actually harm her2. When she was with Seth he fully saw red and tried his best to control himself  WE LOVE A JEALOUS POSSESIVE MEN4. Lastly I will never forget how Darcy SLAPPED Lance and lived to tell the tale if that was anyone else then god help them 💀😭 The one thing I didn’t like was the long chapters I don’t care if a book is long but short chapters are the way to go I feel like if the chapters are shorter its faster to read the book THE SCIENCE ISN’T SCIENCING 😭  SPOILERS AHEAD⚠️⚠️ Who killed Falling Star AKA professor Astrum just when I was thinking the girls had someone he gets murdered what more did he have to tell them this whole who murdered the twins parents mystery has me hooked“Caleb, take off your shirt and give it to Miss Vega,” Orion snapped.”“Orion shrugged out of his own jacket and handed it to me instead” Lance I Owe you an apology he was always trying to protect the twins its adorable when he told Darcy to go back in and not go with Seth it wasn’t just jealousy its because he knew something was wrong and after the whole attack the way he cracked a joke to make her laugh will ALWAYS have my heart . No I’m not forgetting how he saved Tory and gave everyone a run for their money WE LOVE LANCE. WTF WAS THAT ENDING IM SOO SORRY IT HAD ME IN TEARS  “Told you I'd get your hair,” he said, his voice flat and cold and making my heart crawl into a shell to try and hide. “And since Max told me the little sob story behind it, I was even more determined to get my hands on it.” ” 😭😭😭THE WAY THEY USED DARCY’S TRAUMA ABOUT NOT BEING LOVED BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND LEFT HER AFTER HE HOOKED UP WITH HER SO SHE DYED HER HAIR BLUE TO PORTRAY A BRUISE FOR HOW SHE FELT ONLY FOR SETH TO BREAK DOWN HER WALLS AND THEN THE PRICK CUT OFF HER BLUE LOCKS WHYYYYY HOW CAN YOU BE THAT EVIL “I was there again. Sinking, down, down, down and this time no helpful passerby was going to save me.”MY POOR TORY 😫 DARIUS I WILL COME AND KILL YOU MY SELF FULLY KNOWING SHE CAN NOT SWIM AND HOW SHE WAS LEFT TO DROWN BY HER EX  NOT ONLY  DID YOU GUYS PUSH HER IN A POOL YOU FULLY DROWNED HER IF IT WASN’T FOR LANCE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IS THE KINGDOM THAT IMPORTANT  SPOILERS END HERE ⚠️⚠️⚠️ To end on a lighter note here are some of my favourite funny quotes :“You were a unicorn!” Darcy yelled in confusion as my brain struggled to comprehend what had just happened.  “Pegasus,” Tyler corrected. “And you two were all over me.” “That’s because we thought we were stroking a wild animal not getting molested by some horse-faced weirdo,”“Perfect. I always wanted to be a walking packed lunch,” I said dryly“No she's in Uranus,” he said around a mouthful of food. “Excuse me?” Tory blurted. “Our friend has been hurt and you think it's an appropriate time to start throwing jokes around?” “No,” he said innocently. “She's in Uranus Infirmary, next to Neptune Tower?” “Why is everyone after those emotions?! And why am I even turned on by Lord Voldemort’s hotter, younger cousin?” “Sorry, babe, did I forget to ask your permission? You know I'm totally polyamorous right?”“No Seth, you have never told me that.”“Well you can't go poly-shaming me now can you?” THIS BOOK HAS LITTLE TO NO SMUT WHICH I LOVED SO THERE WAS NO SKIPPING 😍. I WANT TO KILL ALL THE HEIRS BUT I DEFINITELY HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART FOR CALEB ITS ALMOST AS IF HE DIDN’T WANT TO DO IT NOT THAT IT MAKES IT OKAY SO AS MUCH AS I WAS SHIPPING TORY AND DARIUS THE PRICK DOESN’T DESERVE HER 😭",4
"494","46261182","So I read this book.... and it wasn't that bad.  I am totally kidding. It was AWFUL. Jesus Christ, possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  But not THE worst book... (cries in flock and exodus)  Tory and Darcy are torn out of the human world and thrown into this gossip girl school for paranormal bully creatures  because BAM, they have powers and are the real heirs to the throne of SOLARIA. Also they're twins.  No, this is not a Winx Club episode, and for the first 10 chapters I was fuming thinking this was a copy of one of my favorite cartoons of all times but they actually didn't go that far.  Let's start with the fact that this book was sold to me as a: TEACHER-STUDENT BULLY ROMANCE.  There was bullying allright.  You guys know me, I am a sucker for bully romance and teacher-student tropes. I thought this was going to be super hot, I also adore urban fantasies and this had the perfect recipe. Until the main characters were coerced by their classmates to do the chicken dance in front of that said teacher. The actual chicken dance. I wish I was joking. HOW IN THE WORLD AM I SUPPOSED TO BE ATTRACTED TO THIS? Bully Romances are supposed to be intelligent and demeaning in a hot way, not in a: ""I wish I could jump off a building from second hand embarrassment way."" I thought the teacher was going to insult her intelligence, not laugh about her flapping her arms like wings. I am not going to lie, if people weren't waiting for me to write this review I probably would have DNFED right there, but I kept going.  They throw EVERYTHING your way. We have unicorns, dragons, vampires, sirens, werewolves, hydras, harry potter house points (which I learned to ignore)   you are going to have to learn to ignore a lot of things if you want to read this series.  For the first 60% of the book I was so bored and confused, that I decided to play a game.  ""Take a shot every time someone gets bit in the neck FOR NO DAMN REASON.""  My family is officially concerned. I have an AA meeting next week.    The entire plot of this book feels like someone took all the stories you started coming up with after you got your first Ken Doll in third grade.   I HATE YOU BARBIE  NO I HATE YOU  I AM GOING TO BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE  *throws both barbie and ken across the room*  There is ZERO sex, no spice, public humiliation without any emotional return and at certain point you start feeling STUPID for reading this.  Then you get to 65%. If you got this far, you are a war hero. That's when they inject you with the same drug they inject Grey's Anatomy fans to make sure they watch all seasons.  The train wreck you cant stop watching. Zodiac academy actually gives you compelling characters, and I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM SAYING THIS: a world building that makes you feel like you're on crack but it makes sense because it is atmospheric. OH and hot bully dudes who will break your heart.  You spend enough time in the madhouse, you start talking to the walls too.  It's Alice in Wonderland all over again. Yes, I am Alice. I don't wanna go among mad people but I feel like I've been dosed heavily with LSD and there's not much I can do at this point.  SO I  FUCKING  GET IT.  I will be reading the second book and I hate all of you for it. 3 stars for entertainment.  PS: Please read this like a comedy, and think of every possible trigger warning in the book before you jump in.",3
"495","46261182","3.5 starsEveryone in this series is a fucking asshole - and when I say asshole I mean it in every sense of the word:➽ Sexual assault? Okay➽ Drinking everyone's blood? Great➽ Cyber bullying actually EVERY form of bullying? Sure, why not➽ Getting a mere detention for almost killing someone? Fitting➽ Teachers completely not giving a shit? Obviously➽ TEACHERS joining in on the fun above? Totally acceptable➽ Everyone being a horrible human -sorry fae**- being AND ACTING LIKE IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL?? JUST DANDYLet's also not forget some cringy teenage talk from the early 2010s. Words like bae should not be used in any form of literature, even this semi-trash.But you know what? I still really enjoyed this book.And as the laws of physics like to say The things Anna enjoys most are the things Anna can't properly fucking review. But here are some random thoughts:♊ If Harry Potter + Winx Club had explicit (maybe kinda awkward) sex = this would be their love child♊ PLZZZ why does Seth's order remind me of this:♊ Orion is the worst teacher ever. He deadass comes late to everything, assaults, insults, and bites his students while just overall hating everyone😭😭😭 I love this guy. ♊ This book is so addictive but the writing sometimes gives me a headache.♊ The heirs are literally the worst but also.......😗they kinda cute though (except Max. Hate the mf)♊ I know many people love Darcy and Orion more as a couple and my question is ¿porque? I mean they're great but Tory and Darius take superiority on my chemistry scale. ♊ These love triangles are giving me life. I love the drama.♊ Imagine how much time would've been saved if they all acknowledged the fact that the twins ARE NOT interested in the throne. They could band together because they literally have the same goals, like are they slow or what💀?♊ Boy will I sound like a total dickhead but....Darcy's reason for dyeing her hair? LMAO. I expected something way more poetic than some crap about emotional pain being less visible than bruised knees.Especially after hearing Tory's story. The poor girl almost died and here Darcy is talking about her blue & black knees like her hair😭. Her emotional pain is very valid btw, but I don't know why she had to bring her knees into this.♊ The drowning was not dramatic enough. SHE NEEDED TO DIE FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES SO DARIUS FEELS LIKE SHIT AND REGRETS HIS ENTIRE LIFE. But this bitch didn't even make him sweat😒♊
  
    Orion shook his head, his face painted with disappointment. “I thought you of all the Heirs were better than your parents.”
  
I'm so glad I read the prequel before this because then I wouldn't be able to understand- NO FEEL how fucking savage that was. I felt that shit in my toes.♊ Anyways, I hope Darius suffers an eternity after that ending. And Orion just plays all these dumbasses and becomes the king himself🤡",3

what is in this book and why was it so addicting 😭 i enjoyed it MUCH more than i thought i would so here i am, trying to write this review so i can make y'all will read this asap so let's first talk about the things i liked in this book.. it’s giving romance with harry potter vibes but in college and mixed with winx & twilight lol. it's a new school, new world and let's be real, this is so wattpad with all that ""lost twins"" but it was still pretty amazing ngl 😭there is this amazing sibling bond between tory and darcy, i love them with my entire heart and it was hilarious to see tory being a bad b. i usually loathe love triangles but this one gave what it's supposed to give and the drama was batshit good. it was so addictive, i couldn't put it down, so i pulled an all-nighter 😀orion carried this book. he is an awful teacher and i love him so much. insulting his student? yes. putting them in their place? also yes. he never fails to amaze me with his sarcasmhe is just 💗💘💕💞 also his nickname for darcy >>>you can either see this as a pro or con.. but A LOT of drama and emotions and frustrations.. there are like two main couples. i mean, not yet really but there will be. one is [kinda] forbidden and definitely not as toxic as the other one.. and well that one is also pretty frustrating and will probably make me rip my hair out but here goes nothingwas the writing good? absolutely not. sometimes it even felt cringey and cheesy but you know when you have those days when you just need books like that? yep, exactly after finishing the book i have no clue how the guys will redeem themselves because the ending was brutal.. so if they don’t grovel, i will sue 🔪🔪giving this book four stars because overall i still enjoyed the book pretty much. yes, i do dislike the guys but it’s an eight book long series so i think we'll get a lot of character development and redemptions 😌i hope to see a much much much stronger side of tory and darcy in the following books, i can't wait for them to beat these guys up 🤭PLEASE CHECK TRIGGER WARNINGS FOR THE SERIES — i also read that book in one sitting, so if i tell you it's addictive, then fucking believe me 🧌",4
"498","46261182","4.38!""But until that day, you're mine, Blue.""
I am so mad at myself for not reading this sooner but also glad that I'm reading it very close to the last ones release because the cliffhangers that this one had?? I'm sure it'll get worse with each book and I can't wait to read them 🤭 (there's something wrong with me 😔) the writing tbh was not the best writing that I have ever read, it came off as cringe sometimes but nit enough to ruin my experience anf i mean.....it will get better with each book. I love how the twins managed to keep invested in their story. I was so hooked! I can't remember the last time I read a book i a day and a half because of my lord was it so easy to get into and through!Moving on to the characters: •Tory Vega🔥 y'all I know you guys love Darcy more but I can't help it. Tory was easily my favourite character she was so badass and hotheaded plus the way she stood up for herself and Darcy and the way she had these sassy comebacks on the tip of her tongue was the reason why reading this book was a joy also a plus point for Tory is that she's a biker 🤭🤭 I loved her whole arc and I cannot wait to read more of her she will easily be my favourite character (please don't mess up her character arc....otherwise I'll give that book a 1)•Darius Acrux 🥵 okay I know many of you hate him in this book and will hate me for liking him....but I KNOW THERES A REASON WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID! There has to be one and I also read the prequel so I know that the Darius we saw in that was still the Darius here. He has his reasons and just trust the process and don't call me out on this because I'm incapable of giving two shits.•Darcy Vega 💙 she was more calm, not as fiery as Rory but still had a backbone to stand up for herself, I actually want to know more about her. I didn't mind her chapters at all infact I loved them equally because she had this vibe in her rpoint of view and the way she made me laugh 😭 also man in those last chapters I WAS SCREAMING AT HER TO TRUST ORION UFFF 😭 but okay it's fine let's see what happens next with her.•Lance Orion 🥃 how can a man be a bitch while also being charming, sophisticated, hot and a gentlemanish??? Because I saw all of that in him.....I saw people.callikg him a dilf and I cant even argue in that point. He was more sensible where Darius was impulsive he was more intuitive and the end chapters had me rooting for him so much because HE FINALLY DID SOMETHING!! The whole book i was waiting for something to happen to see why everyone likes him so much, until I did but tbh I need more of him and his arc because what we got was not enough 😩 when are gonna get their povs!! (I started book 2 so ik we get Caleb's first 🙄)•The three heirs 👹👹👹 max, imagine having a mohawk and being a bitch?? Like pick a struggle. Seth I'm sorry but you're not funny and for Caleb, the only thing your good at is biting and fucking and that is not a compliment (I might regret saying these things later but as of not i hate them and yes you can see my double standards)The romance 😩 listen I know BlueLance is >>>> but don't come at me because for me it was ToryDarius>BlueLance and listen!!! We barely get scenes for both those couples but from what we got ToryDarius had more angst and tension than BlueLance they were literally so hot together and I WANT THEM TO BE TOGETHER but I know it's a slow burn and I don't mind because I love those but this series is like 9 books I'm either going to be bored of them being together or I'll loose interest if they don't get together! Let's see how the author tackles that as for BlueLance they have massive potential, I just did not think they had enough scenes together to make me enjoy their crumbs that much, I mean they had scenes, more than ToryDarius but they weren't angsty like that ykwim?? But I really want to see why it's.loved so much and it is gonna be explored more so 🤭The plot, the world building and the magic system. The plot didn't really start until we were past the 50% point and I did not mind it because I was actually liking the way the story was developing plus the characters and the or interactions and the way it was written was really but also the stakes were high at times and I was speeding through page after page to get to the end and my jaw would occasionally drop on the floor so kudos to the sisters for that! As for the world building I'd say it was done a decent amount and for a very basic magic system I found myself being very intrigued by it so it was done good as well!I actually really enjoyed and would've given it more stars of it had a more prominent plot!____
  IQRA IF I FAIL MY EXAMS IM GIVING MY MOTHER YOUR NUMBER
____I was gonna start this next week but I can't help myself! I NEED TO READ THIS NOW!!Can't wait to meet the twins and Darius and Lance 👀 I'm coming for you *pushes people away*",4
"499","46261182","This book summed up in two words: Torture porn. Essentially this is about two teens getting abused and violated in every possible way. This is marketed as “sexy Harry Potter.” I would amend that to “problematic Harry Potter” except that Harry Potter itself is already kinda problematic so…Yes, I was warned going in that this was going to be a “bully romance”, as the kids call it these days when you romanticize entitled brat dickheads. (This is not me throwing shade at people who like to read bully romance—I get it. Read whatever you want. Not my business to judge.)So basically, I was reading with my hands over my eyes the whole time, peeking through my fingers. But the hype was too alluring. And sometimes, rarely, these types of books turn out to have an unrivaled guilty pleasure appeal that leaves me tearing through a series in just a few days. However Zodiac Academy is just bad…in every way…seriously…🙃 The writing is cringey and in serious need of better editing. 🙃 The love interests are evil trash heaps. 🙃 All the characters, especially the side characters, are flat empty caricatures, right down to the Latino best friend who manages to insert a Spanish word in every sentence. 🙃 The entire premise is so blatantly ripped off from Harry Potter, including the houses, the points system, and the stupidly obvious character names. The werewolf teacher is named Professor Canis, the fire teacher is called Professor Pyro, and the earth teacher—I shit you not—is named Professor Rockford.Apparently the entire faculty of this school is no better than the dwarves in Snow White.So amid this setup we have Darcy and Tory, twins who, like I mentioned earlier, spend the entire time being bullied and abused in every possible way. Apparently survival of the fittest is the rule in this academy. For instance, there are vampires who will prey on the other students whenever they feel like it, and everybody is fine with this because apparently if you’re not strong enough to defend yourself against bloodsuckers then you deserve to be bitten. (I mean, if it talks like rape culture and walks like rape culture, don’t be shocked when it turns out to be rape culture.) And as the twins were never taught any magic whatsoever and the professors at the school are good for nothing, they can’t defend themselves and get bitten every few days. I don’t know how they haven’t keeled over from blood loss. I also don’t know why they haven’t resorted to bringing a gun to class. If you have to get by with survival of the fittest, a Glock is a great way to instantly become a whole lot fitter. Just sayin…Here’s the very insidious thing about this series. I have no plans to continue, but I can’t guarantee that I won’t. The main characters are treated so horribly that some part of me demands I keep going just to see them get some justice. I want to see those vile Heirs dead. Orion needs to die too. (I know this story is more likely to end with the men getting head than getting dead, but a girl can hope.)So if you do see me starting book 2 at some point in the future…just look the other way, please and thank you 🙏",1

"501","46261182","approximately 60% of the plot was unserious so to an unserious review we go!i love to surprise myself even if i hate surprises. i started the book convinced it would be a chore to go through it. honestly, it was challenging to get fully invested in the story at first; there wasn’t enough depth to tory and darcy’s thoughts to get really attached to them but, i closed the book without completely hating it. thoughts:➺ Orion didn’t smell only bourbon, he had major hot-daddy vibes with a chef’s kiss sarcasm going on. he was the only decent man male who deserves to live in this mad book. 
  ""Orion is so hot,” Kylie whispered, her voice carrying to my ears. ""Yeah and he knows it."" The girl beside her smothered a laugh.  ""He does know it, because he has Vampire hearing."" Orion looked up from his desk, pinning them in his sharp gaze.
➺ Darcy: i just wanted to hug her for half of the book and scream at her, for the second half, to bang her teacher already. i don’t understand why they aren’t called 
  blue balls
 instead of bluelance in this book. because DarcyOrion’s sexual tension was palpable and exciting only through pages but definitely made me prego.😮‍💨
  ""But until that day, you're mine, Blue.”
➺ The Heirs are the male version of Mean Girls but make it ✨surnaturel✨. i hated them at first and loathed their existence at the end.🙂➺ Tory. what a baddie with fire repartee she was. nothing much, nothing less to say.➺ for the ToryDarius groupies (anmol, cait katy kitten don’t jump to my throat, u psychos) : they haven’t a lot of interaction and there was so many occasions to throw them in eventual, entertaining verbal jousts. so yeah, not enough material to write about them except i enjoyed the few querelles they had.➺ Faebook, FIB : the way the authors haven’t put any efforts in the parallel world appellations is gold.➺ Geraldine should be protected at all costs, her character is so precious!➺ why no adult was acutely adulting in this book ?😭 i get that they don’t have the same morals as the mortals but c’mon!!and now jumping to the second book hoping there’s more world building and characters depth. wish me luck!~•~•~•~joining the gang😗",3
"502","46261182","Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThis has been on my radar for a while but I've avoided reading it because I thought it was set in a high school (and I don't really like reading romances set in high school) and because the people who were shipping it generally shipped other fantasy authors whose works I didn't like, and contrary to some people's beliefs, I am not a hate-reader. When I pick up a book, it's because I genuinely want to like it. The one-star review is a reflection of my disappointment.But I kept seeing people picking up this series and loving it and then I found out that it's set in university and not high school, so it felt like the literal stars were conspiring against me, taking away my reasons for not reading this book one by one, and I was like FINE UNIVERSE. I'LL READ YOUR STUPID SMUT GOD. And guess what... I. LOVED. IT. I really fucking loved it. I read book one in one day, in just a few hours. Even though it was almost 500 hundo pages. W H A T.Here's the thing. When I was a teen-- YES I AM OLD-- there was this magical site called Quizilla. And one of my favorite things to read on that website were harem paranormals where the girl could end up with any one of an entire Pokemon booster pack of men with different supernatural powers. I would stay up until 5am reading those trashy stories and every once in a blue moon, I'll come across something self-published that has that same addictive, cracky qualia of just being impossible to put down, gratuitously self-indulgent, and resplendently fun to read. And for me, THE AWAKENING, was that book.I almost didn't make it through the beginning because the desperate edginess of their normie setting almost put me off. TWO police chases before the 10% mark??? That seems excessive, MA'AMS. But then Professor Orion barged into the scene and things got really good. I loved the descriptions of Zodiac Academy and the world-building was genuinely amazing. The opulent dorms and dining hall, the enchanted ""pegasus"" meadow, the classrooms named after planets-- IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. But even though it looks and quacks like a fairytale... it's not. Darcy and Tory Vega find out that they're the heirs to the fae kingdom and even though they have ALL THE POWERS, they don't know how to use them. And people resent them for having the power and for upsetting the status quo, and so basically everyone bullies and fucks with them (except for a small contingent of royalists who stan their family the way people used to stan the Queen of England). Which actually made a lot of sense.Fuck those interlopers. The new rulers who have stepped into the void of their fae parents' deaths are called the heirs. There's Darius, the dragon. Seth, the werewolf. Caleb, the vampire. And Max, the siren. Like everyone else in the school, they've each specialized in a single element-- fire, air, earth, and water-- and like everyone else in the school, they have a bone to pick with the interlopers. A lot of the bullying takes the form of sexual harassment, which is typical in bullymances. I personally am not bothered by this-- honestly, if you've read Hana Yori Dango, some of the stuff that happens in that book is way worse-- but it's something to think about if you have triggers. Personally, I liked the distinction about it being all about power; it made sense that the fae would brutalize each other like that to show animal dominance.As big a part as the romance is when it comes to setting the stage, a lot of the book is also about the sisters struggling to develop and control their powers, while also trying to take in this whole other world they didn't even know about. At first it's disorienting trying to take in all of these names and descriptions, but that translates to the characters' bewilderment as well, and it's really well done. We learn about the world as the characters do and whether that's brilliant writing or a happy accident, I don't even care because I loved it and didn't want it to be over. These classrooms are way more dangerous than the ones in Harry Potter and the teachers are just as cruel as the students. There's also a sort of romance with one of the sisters and their hot vampire professor, Lance Orion. He's actually the love interest I liked the most, because even though he was an asshole, he was an asshole to everyone. This is a man who will crack someone's head against a desk for backtalking him. Although if I'm pressed, I'd say that my favorite of the boys was probably Caleb just because I'm a sucker for vamps.I ended up really liking Darcy and Tory. I do agree with the criticisms that their POVs are pretty similar and it was easy to confuse them but they ARE twins so I guess it makes sense that they'd be alike?? I also liked how they simped for each other and always had each other's backs. The girl on girl hate was also pretty minimal for a bullymance. I liked how the girls were kind of disgusted when the guys slut-shamed other women and how some of the girls weren't treated as rivals but as friends. Nothing was perfect, but it felt more realistic and less a reliance on gross gender stereotypes, even though the word ""alpha"" was used in here about twenty times too many, and I began eye-rolling at the mention of a muscled chest (because of course, it happened every time something with a dick walked on stage).I've developed a bit of a reputation on this site for being a picky snob and that's probably true, but my standards are actually pretty low. All I ask is to be entertained. This book more than served me up in that regard and I've already got book two on standby. I'm wildly jealous of the authors for thinking up this delicious, slutty hodgepodge of Vampire Academy, Harry Potter, and Cruel Prince, and now I guess I have to read thousands and thousands of pages of this self-indulgent fanfiction to find out how it ends.#BYE4 to 4.5 stars",4
"503","46261182","2.5 starsThis is honestly a book I'm shocked has so many high ratings...yikes. The writing wasn't that great and there was just too much going on and not enough romance. Like, what is this world?? I'm so confused. I know it's a series, but there are different paranormal creatures but there are also elemental powers and royalty and evil animals and coercion and tarot cards and astrology and Schoo ""houses"" and...what?? I felt like too much was thrown in and not explored enough. The bully aspect also really didn't work with me. It was very tropey and cheesy and not exactly well written. Then, the girls are very naive when it comes to blindly believing and following the people who bully them...THEY LITERALLY HATE YOU SO WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING AND TRUSTING THEM? It was annoying. They also blindly trusted someone anonymously messaging them and I was just so frustrated with their decision. Literally everyone hates you and is bullying you and you're going to trust a random anonymous person who is messaging you? SURE. Also, are they supposed to be sophomores in high school or college? I thought they were in college, but the way they acted had me questioning if they were really supposed to be 16...This follows twins Darcy and Tory, and the story is told in their dual POV. It was SO HARD for me to differentiate the chapters between who was who. They were not written differently at all and I really struggled remembering whose chapter I was in. Then, neither one of them even have an inkling of a real romance until probably 80% in. For a romance series, I really need the romance to develop early on for me to have an investment into the series. I just didn't care by the time anything developed. And the ending wasn't that much of a cliffhanger like so many people were saying and I was just left not impressed. I don't see myself ever picking this series back up...",2

🔮🌟I can see why this series is so addictive, mostly in a junk food wattpad way. I hadn't planned on reading the next book immediately after the prequel but I couldn't focus on any of the other books I was reading. I straight up inhaled a 500 pg book and it felt like half that cause it was delicious fluff 🧁 This series would make a great tv show, the setting is basically a NA new-age Hogwarts and the Vega twins are just... dope. Gen z and cool and so relatable. Honestly CW channel where you at this is so your vibe ⤴⤵͖ ⤴⤵͖ The magic system was a lot of fun and in terms of being clear, concise, and easy to understand, JLA pls take some notes. The things that I didn't like come down to personal preference. While I liked the idea of the four elements (air, earth, water, and fire) and having an heir represent each element, the concept brought us rather close to reverse harem vibes, which admittedly I try to avoid. They never crossed that line, but it was still there. I didn't like that Darius would let his friends manhandle Tory and that both twins were dealing w multiple love interests. On the other end of that spectrum, if I was into RH, I'd feel blue balled by the setup for it that the book doesn't follow through on, so either way you look at the romantic concept of the four heirs, I don't really think it's winning. The only heir that is relevant and compelling as of now is Darius, so I can definitely do without the other three shitstains.Darius: perfect for tory, lots of potential, want him to lean into the misunderstood bad boy thing and out of the egotistical douchebag thingCaleb: his energy is at an 8-9 and i need him to bring it down to a tolerable 2-3. his only personality traits are being spineless, obnoxious, and mounting toryMax: never heard of himSeth: wish i could say i'd never heard of him but unfortunately i have and he's a twerp like calebHowever, ⚡️the shining light⚡️Orion: king of never missing, dunk after dunk after dunk
  ""Your real parents swapped you with the twins born to that couple.""""That's not true. You're insane. Why would they do that?""""My guess? You were in danger,"" he said with a shrug. ""Or maybe you just annoyed them as much as you're annoying me right now and they decided to swap you for less irritating twins.""
  Orion turned to the board, writing on it with his digital pen.YOU ARE NOT UNIQUE.
  ""Miss Vega if you're not standing up in the next three seconds, you're going to regret it,"" Orion barked. ""Which Vega?"" Tory asked, barely concealing her jibing tone. Orion's eyes snapped to her. ""The one who has tried to individualise herself by dying the ends of her hair blue. It has failed by the way.""
  Safe to say that Orion can dunk on me any day of the week. I'm excited for more magic, more Darcy & Orion, more Tory & Darius, but I see a lot of frustration in my future @ pointless love triangles cough cough Caleb 😒 Let's hope at least Seth is out of picture in the Darcy/Orion ship.PS. this is the third book i've read where the hero tries to drown the heroine and at this point i might create a bookshelf to start collecting all these precious gems",3
"505","46261182","3.25 stars ⭐️⤷ spoiler-free review!! ⋆౨ৎ˚⟡˖ ࣪i think going into this book with an open mind was what helped me get through it. i didn’t love it, but i didn’t hate it either. i really liked the premise and the academic setting of the book. however, the pacing felt pretty slow, and i was lowkey kinda bored (i was in a bit of a slump, which might explain why i felt that way 🥲). i hated the celestial heirs, and the constant bullying got tiring over time. i have mixed feelings about professor orion as well, though i have to admit he’s kind of hot 🫢🫣 on the other hand, i loved the vega twins, especially tory. i admired how they always looked out for each other and remained resilient despite the many challenges they faced at the academy. i understand this book sets up the rest of the series, and i’ve heard it gets better from the second book, so i’m going to continue reading and hope you guys are right 🙏🏻pre-read ♊️❤️:finally starting ZA because kendall said she’s gonna fight me if i don’t BAHAHAHA 😭 jokes aside, i’m super intimidated yet excited to step into this series 😖 wish me luck besties 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",3

    ”The most important thing I’d learned in life? You can’t trust people. And you especially can’t trust boys with wicked smiles and equally wicked intentions.”
  
omg??? this book was actually so interesting and intriguing, if i didn’t have to study, i would’ve eaten this up in two days.since lots of ppl don’t know whether to start this series or not, this review will be completely SPOILER-FREE.︵‿︵‿୨♡ ａｂｏｕｔ ｔｈｅ b o o k ♡୧‿︵‿this story follows Tory and Darcy, twin sisters and orphans. they just turned 18 and escaped their last foster family. they don’t have much money and we know since the very first chapter that both tory and darcy try to earn money from illegal action. one night, tory meets professor orion. he explains to her that they’re from another world and they must attend the zodiac academy (basically Hogwarts), where they’ll have an inheritance and a roof on their heads.now, i feel like i should explain a couple of things that might make you interested in this series.the new world to which tory and darcy are going, is a fae world (don’t think about neither tog nor acotar), called solaria. the fae ppl are divided in orders (vampires, werewolves, sirens, dragons etc…) and every person belongs to one. they also have powers which are basically 4 elements (fire, water, earth and air): a person can have one, or max 2 elements.that said, i should say how the school works.there are ofc the 4 houses (one for each element), with a captain. everyone has an atlas, which is an ipad/iphone with apps and shit. they get every morning their horoscope and they also have an app called faebook—a social network slay— which is hilarious if you think about it. but basically they’re all ipad kids. another interesting thing is that the buildings in school are named after the planets. okay, i think this is all you need to know, the amount of info is enough to make you intrigued in this series!!this book has very long ass chapters, so prepare yourselves bc some chapters are 40 minutes long. criminal, i know. but the writing is good, very colloquial so it’s not hard to follow; it’s basically told by 18yo, so it’s pretty simple. the pace is pretty fast. and even tho the chapters are long, the story is captivating enough that you don’t get bored or annoyed by the length. a lot happens, but at the same time you have enough time to learn about the magic system, the world building etc… ★ tropes ★ this is a fantasy/bully romance. so yeah, the vega sisters have hot enemies/bullies.even tho, it’s also a romance, this has no romance whatsoever at least til 87% of the book. so don’t expect an insta love or something bc you’ll be disappointed. and i wouldn’t consider it a slow burn either. i’m pretty sure we’ll see more of the romance part in the other books, but so far it’s almost nonexistent.now, let’s talk about the characters really quick.➼ tory is badass but with a hint of fear that makes her even more relatable. she’s more extrovert than her sister and she always speaks up for her and darcy. she’s also interested in fashion and buy clothes for both of them. idk much about her to fully describe her and convince you to love her. just know that she’s my fav twin so far.➼ darcy is calm as the water and her blue hair. she’s an introvert, she definitely has trust issues and she’s the kind of person that always feels bad or guilty about treating badly others.she’s an early bird and the kind of girly who reads horoscope every morning.i really liked her but not as much as tory. but she’s cool nonetheless!➼ professor orion is a professor of the school (duh). he’s the one who came to the mortal world to pick up the vega sisters. he’s mysterious and sus asf. and ofc he’s also hot asf.
   ★ the celestial heirs ★“Max Rigel,” (the dark skinned demi-god). “Caleb Altair,” (the blonde haired beaux next door), “Darius Acrux,” (my sin-filled fantasy). “And Seth Capella,” (the long haired lothario).”
ofc i had to spend two words about them.starting by my fav bc i love bastards.➼ darius acrux is a bastard through and through. he’s the captain of the house of fire and ofc he made it his mission to make tory’s life a living hell. he’s a hottie too.
  
     “Fire focus, House Ignis. We aren't for the faint of heart.
  
➼ caleb altair is the captain of earth house. he’s charming and the classic bad boy who doesn’t start things but still enjoys wickedness.he’s blond but i must admit he has rizz.
  
     “Earth focus, House Terra. And terror is exactly what you'll get if you don't fit in.”
  
➼ seth capella was hard to figure out bc there were moments i liked him, and then he did something stupid and i was like “i hate you sm”. he’s the captain of air house, he has long hair and ofc he’s handsome too. 
  
     “Air focus, House Aer. Life with us is a breeze.”
  
➼ max rigel is the worst tbh. he’s the captain of water house. he likes to feed on emotions, especially fear. he used this against ppl to make them suffer. tbh, idk much about him bc he wasn’t so present in this book. 
  
    “Water focus, House Aqua. My house is for those who have what it takes to face the deadly sea of life in Zodiac without flinching.”
  
they’re all bullies and don’t want tory and darcy in the zodiac academy, so they try to make their lives a living hell. but hey, it’s bully romance after all, it seems only fair that you have mixed feelings about them.overall, this book was really amazing. it kept me interested from the beginning to the last page. the story is intriguing and keeps you curious all throughout the book with the Falling Star mysterious identity. i’d definitely recommend this series so far, even tho it’s really long, i think it’s worth a try. onto the next!!💋
  
    Yes, my newfound power had overwhelmed me but I couldn’t deny just how good it felt as it writhed beneath my skin. It made me feel fearless, powerful, unstoppable. Every dream I’d ever had suddenly seemed irrelevant. The world held so much more than it ever had. And it was ready for Darcy and I to take our places amongst it.His face was cut from my very own personal fantasy, as if someone had delved into my deepest desires and drawn them into strong angles and perfect temptation made just for me.“Where I’m from I found out the hard way that this life will throw all kinds of crap at you, but the one thing you don’t have to accept is other people’s bullshit.”Tears never did anyone any favours, but sometimes they just needed to fall.“I'm not shy, you're just so far beyond my personal boundaries right now I can't even see them anymore.”There was no way in hell I’d be ending up in his bed tonight. I was at least sixty-seven percent certain of that.Because despite the fact that Darius Acrux was a complete and utter asshole who had made it his mission to make my life a living hell, he was still my exact brand of temptation.I knew I was difficult to love but I didn’t think I was entirely unlovable.“Earth to Darcy, please tell me you're not interested in that perro?”I didn't answer. Partly because I didn't know what perro meant, but also because I didn't know what the answer was.Don’t trust the flames. Claim your throne. - Falling Star",4
"507","46261182","Wow that was an enjoyable ride. Y'all were not lying when you said it's amazing.It's fast paced, interesting..so damn interesting and full of DRAMA. It never got boring. The plot is intriguing and kept me hooked. I could not keep this down. The whole concept of Zodiac Academy is super interesting to me. (Though, I would like to be defensive and say am not into Zodiac and horoscope in reality😂). The writing could've been slightly better in my opinion. Darcy and Tory are such great leads. I can't wait to see how their story unfolds later in the series. They clearly hold a lot of power and potential and I definitely want to see them unleash their full powers. Don't get me started on the narcissistic Heirs. I really didn't like them at all..at least not in this book. Bully romance? No..It was just bullying. They're manipulative thugs. Though I sense redemption in Caleb? Or maybe not; will just have to wait and see. I definitely liked Orion from the beginning 🥵 (I have issues). Overall, pretty enjoyable. Can't wait to start with the next one😀",4
"508","46261182","what illegal substances were in those digital pages? because i am frothing at the mouth for my next hit.surprised? yeah, me too.2.5/5 stars.i understand that this is the literary equivalent of when i magically lose three days because i fell into 4 seasons of love island, so please know i'm not pretending this is shakespeare's career defining play, but there were still some things that i had problems with, so hear me out.i spent this entire book feeling like something about this was so harry potter meets divergent meets wattpad, and i spent the entire book being right. it so belongs in the early to mid 2010s dystopian craze that swept up the world, and i kind of love that.honestly, it's just so much fun. absolutely mindless reading. and it has a pretty unique rhythm of consistent, intermittent adrenaline rushes, up and down and up and down, that are just so addicting, in comparison to a writer like sarah j maas whose style is building up to a big thrill at the end. the magic system here is actually very interesting, even if it felt a bit messy in the beginning.(sidebar to talk about how unrealistic the beginning was. no one in chicago's rent is 2000 for a few months. and also why couldn't they just get jobs??)and anyways you know that? i actually didn't hate the main characters!!that being said, i did hate just about everyone else though.geraldine is hands down my favorite character, because the comic relief through her character was perfect.but going a little bit darker, i am not a bully romance person.this book is a lot, and while i'm not usually one to be triggered by something in a book (other than dramatically flying off the handle because i feel like it), it's pretty dark.the fmcs seem to be able to handle it, but that honestly doesn't much soothe my concerns about it. it also rubs me the wrong way that these people are going to be love interests because ew.the whole thing makes me very uncomfortable, but i've been told it gets better so i'm hoping! but that was the primary reason this wasn't a 3 star or higher.also, i don't like orion. he's a bully and he's very pushy and rude and so it doesn't feel endearing to me, just icky.another thing- I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT HOW MUCH TESTOSTERONE THEY HAVE. i am so sick of reading the word alpha unironically.it's bringing up long buried buried omegaverse fan fiction trauma i thought i was well and done with.overall, i had some complaints, but it was fun! don't mind me launching my ass on over to book two-",3
"509","46261182","Darcy/Tory - idk, i can't keep them apart, neither do i want to learn to - constantly going ""oh yeah, he tried to kill me but he's just so hot you know?"" has the same energy as the Dahmer thirst traps on tiktokyou all have fun with your bully ""romances"" and sex addicts' fever dreams, but i'm too old for thisi honestly don't know how you do it. this not only gave me a headache but i will also blame it for the sprained ankle and food poisoning i ""acquired"" in the time i tried to read this. dnf @33%. thank god Ridds agreed or i might have had to threaten her",1
"510","46261182","""The most important thing I’d learned in life? You can’t trust people. And you especially can’t trust boys with wicked smiles and equally wicked intentions.""There is definitely a crack in this book because THIS. IS. FREAKING. ADDICTING. Like I hated so much in this all the bullying and the celestial heirs but still couldn't stop reading it. I already knew that I'm going to be very addicted to this series but this is something else. I loved the world building. It was perfect and one of the main reasons I got so invested in this and yess I AM FINALLY A ZODIAC ACADEMY ADDICT.The plot is full of drama and there is always something happening mostly bad things. Bad things to Vega twins. It still has the one of the most used plotline where the girl is of a coming age and suddenly she realised she has power and now she has to fight for the world. Typical? I know I know. But when I say this one is different even though the ZA world still involved Magic and Faes. It is different. Because this whole story is more like character driven and the also the mystery in this is very very intriguing. Some of the characters are horrible and fucked up and some are just amazing that I want to protect them so badly and the whole mystery about what exactly happened to Vega twins and their parents and the whole dark magic thing in is perfect and will keep you wanting more and more. I can't say much about writing except it was simple which made me read it very fast. 
  ╰┈➤ Things I love the most
➛ The magical world (Solaria)➛ Faes and their powers➛ The shape shifting powers➛ The Orders mostly Vampires and Dragons and the Zodiacs➛ The powers of elements 💨🔥🍃🌊 and stars 💫➛ The humour and the witty banter➛ THE WHOLESOME SIBLING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TORY AND DARCY 💘 (both twins are my favourite and I'm not choosing any single one)➛ Tory and the badass things she did and her sassy mouth➛ The palpable tension between Orion and Darcy➛ The angst and hatred between Darius and Tory (I want him to grovel and beg her in the next book or I'm done shipping them)It was a rollercoaster of emotions because how many times did I wanted to punch them in the face or throw my kindle away because they frustrated me so much. How many times I was furious when they tried to bully Vega twins and how many times I laughed reading the funny puns. I have lost count at this point. ✦ Darcy VegaShe is the most relatable and the practical twin and I love how clumsy she can be sometimes but also stands up for herself and her sister when needed. She always tries to do her best. She may not be the fierce twin sister but she is a badass in her own way, who is attracted to hot jerks or shall I say hot-as-fucking-hell professor 👀 Darcy is me. I am Darcy🫂 ✦ Tory VegaThe badass, bold and fearless twin. I love her and I really hope she kicks some more asses in book 2 mostly of The Heirs because the way they tried to almost kill her is fucked up. Tory is the one with spontaneous decisions but I love her for how she never let anyone walk over her. Plus I love her humor 🔥
  ➙ The sisterhood bond between Vega twins
I love both the sisters and their wholesome relationship so much. They both cared for each other so deeply and support each other no matter what. Yes they are opposite of each other but they never tried to use that against each other. Do they hide secrets from each other? I think yes they do. But they are not here in ZA as rivals. They are here as the Vega twins. The sisters who will do anything to protect each other.
  “Don’t underestimate the depths of vengeance. My sister and I have more power than the lot of you, and you’d be fools to think we won’t remember what we went through while we were getting to grips with handling it.”
✦ Lance OrionA Handsome professor with Chef's kiss sarcasm and who smells like cinnamon and bourbon. First of all he is Lance and HAS DIMPLES and HUMOR (which had me dying) and second of all he is a Libra and third he doesn't give a shit to anyone so I am already love him so much 💘 He is the only male character who didn't frustrated me in this book so I really hope the authors won't do anything to my hot mysterious professor or I'll bring chaos 🥰 his obsession with Darcy had no limits lmao! Like how he tried to possess her before Caleb could make her his ""Vamp blood source"". Can't I have hot professor who would do things like this for me???
  ""Careful Miss Vega expressions like that are punishable in my classroom.""
YES SIR 🧎🏽‍♀️
  ""Orion's brows had raised during my list and now he was grinning, his dimple out in full force.""

  𝘏𝘦 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴 𝘶𝘱 𝘨𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘢 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘭 💘
✦ The Celestial HeirsI. Hate. All. Of. Them. And. They. Deserve. To. Be. In. Prison. For. Their. Crimes.I didn't think that they would take all this bullying to this level. It was horrible. Their whole personality is nothing just cocky fucked up assholes who can't control their testesrones. I get it they felt threatened by Vega twins because of all this throne and power but they didn't have to go this far. At first it was small pranks and bullying but that drowning thing they did to Tory was pure attempted murder and nothing less. And I know Tory and she's gonna make them regret every single thing they did to the them. ➸ Darius Acrux: Remember how I said I love him when I read the prequel novella. Yeah I might change my statement now if he doesn't start grovelling or begging to Tory. I get it he had his reasons but he didn't need to take it all out on Tory. Yes I was attracted towards him because who wouldn't? He has dark vibes and had black hair and black eyes and has muscular body and he is freaking GOLDEN DRAGON??! I was sold like Tory but nah he needs to redeem himself in the next books.➸ Caleb Altair: oh boy I really thought he would change or maybe will try to change but guess what he is too fucked up to even stop his friends but then he starts acting all this possessive over Tory because for what? She is his walking talking blood source!?!? But its still true that Caleb is the only heir I would believe. He is bad and possessive but also had this ""I'm bad but I won't harm you."" kind of vibe? ➸ Seth Capella: Boy you are much better and pretty when you are just howling and running in the woods. And please for the love of god there is no such thing as Mouth Thumping 😭 FUCK. OF. SETH.➸ Max Rigel: The emotions sucker siren. I really hate sirens now and I hate him so much for how he tried his fucked up power on twins to tell their fears to him so he and his buddies can mess with them. So no I don't like him.
  ➙ Lance and Darcy #BLUELANCE
I ship them your honor. I ship them so badly 😭💘 And the tension between them is just so perfect and palpable. Like I wanted Darcy to just jump on him. Also their forbiddeness adds more to their dynamic. They both are so obsessed with each other and their eyes always found each other. So romantic. I also know they are going to be my favourite couple in this series. I really want them to build trust between them which is nowhere to be seen right now, but I know they are inevitable. And Lance calls her BLUE 🤭💙 Yes! I'm all in for #BLUELANCE
  “Blue, you’re with me.” He pointed at me and I scowled at the nickname.I lifted my chin and the air became thick between us. “One day, Professor, I'm going to be strong enough to fight you off.” He took a measured breath and I felt like he was sucking something vital out of my body that I wasn’t sure I’d ever get back. “I know,” he said, his eyes glittering. “But until that day, you're mine, Blue.”

  ➙ Darius and Tory
Do I ship them?? YESS BECAUSE THEY ARE INEVITABLE but also not right now until he begged Tory and until Tory take her revenge on him. I want all the angst and enemies to lovers but I also want Darius to treat her the way she deserves to be treated. There is not much ToryDarius in this which hopefully changes in book 2 🤞The ending. Well it's a cliffhanger with a upcoming mystery plotline and all. And I'm already in too deep with this series and these characters so why not just binge read the rest of the books now!! 
  Drugs? Hell no!!Zodiac Academy?? YESS IT IS THE BEST KIND OF CRACK!!
—————————————————————————The fomo was too much to handle so here I am finally starting my journey of Zodiac Academy 🤭 I have a feeling I'm going to be very very very addicted to this crack 😙",4

"512","46261182","3.75 ‘Why did I always have to want the bad guys?’ Stars (I did round up because of enjoyment!) Thoughts:Vampires, werewolves and dragons, oh my!I have nothing to say and everything to say. I’ll keep it brief because everyone should go into this story spoiler free and with little expectations just for the pure shock of it.This book was a flaming trash bin, and I am the bedazzled garbage who was thrown in and consumed, and I don’t mind it for a minute! For everyone saying this is addictive and like crack, you are correct. I don’t even know if it would be my first drug of choice, but here I am high off of it.The Awakening reads like a higher quality wattpad fic, and this is said in the nicest way. And if you disagree just know this is a line from it: “I released a breath I hadn't realised I'd been holding.” Enough said, but I will add that the other reasoning for me to believe this is because of the outfit descriptions. I died cackling.The writing is sometimes atrocious. I even found spelling and grammatical errors, but those issues never took me out of the story somehow. The world building could use some more growth and the magic system could use some explanation, but I’m hoping we will get more as the series goes on. It’s almost like we are in the mystery of it all like Darcy and Tory. The pace of this book and story telling is fantastic though!Some character opinions:Darcy: Protect at all costs! This is my girl (even though at the moment I love both sisters equally)! Darcy is the most relatable, and I truly feel for her the most in this book.Tory: Fiery and passionate! I love her. Her not being able to resist the red flags in her life because of a pretty face is also high-key relatable too. She’s our little sleuth! Her one liners and drop the mic comments are everything!Orion: Looks like I’ve joined a new supremacy. Professor Sexy took me through a whirlwind of emotions. “But until that day, you're mine, Blue.” With nicknames like blue and little bunny, I am about to change my own name legally! However, I still would like to fight him as well because he deserves it (also as an excuse to put my hands on him!). That being said: Orion>>>Heirs: Bite me (but some of you low-key please do)! They do not deserve any of my words or attention at this time though, so no comment.Major Takeaways:-If you are fae then you have to be hot as f*ck. That’s just the rules. (Books need to be renamed Hot Zodiac Academy)-Trust literally no one.I knew this was a bully romance series and thought I was prepared for it. I was in no way prepared for everyone to be a bully! I want to see the Vegas reign and rain hellfire! P.s. One major qualm is why there isn’t a female heir? Second the non-con and questionability is strong with this one so tread carefully. Also besides the daily horoscopes for the sisters, I would also love to start seeing some more horoscope tie-ins with other characters too.P.p.s. The Harry Potter and Percy Jackson vibes are everything!P.p.p.s. I am still suspicious of everyone and cannot wait to see where we go next!Halo, babe, this was such an amazing “experience” to share together!

"514","46261182","No, this wasn't for me.Notes:🅐 This wasn't strictly a bully romance, it was more like a difficult romance that was super hard to read and just a ton of bullying.🅑 The romances were super confused. Two MCs both with love triangles that somehow merged a little and created a love hexagon? No thanks.🅒 The two main characters were confusing, they were twins and super alike, so it was like reading the same character with the same thinking just different name.🅓 Didn't actually like any of the characters, most apparently were just shallow mean people, no depth to their character at all. Not realistic.🅔 The actual 'Zodiac Academy' had very little to do with the story, apart from giving you some horoscope predictions, I couldn't see the whole 'zodiac' inside this book. Shame.I can understand why some people might like this 'bully romance', but in my opinion I have read way better bully romances that are actually romances, not just bullying.

I love the concept of Zodiac Academy itself, the orders and the overall storyline. As it goes for characters, I only like Lance. The rest of them were so flat, I still can't differentiate the twins, the heirs are carbon copies of each other. Not a single good line, nothing to highlight, not one single comeback was funny.

"519","123008168","➸ 1 starmy first 1 star read of the year!! i genuinely don’t think i’ll read a worse book than whatever tf this shit was this year. 😩honestly, if you told me AI wrote this book, i would believe you. i was vibing with this book at the start, the banter was good but it just went downhill from there and it became an excruciating read. the back and fourth was annoying, both mmcs are cringy, obnoxious, stupid and irritating. i knew i should’ve dnfd this when the fmc was only eating the cream from an oreo and he said he wanted to replace the cream w his cum or when he made her gurgle his cum (i literally physically cringed here) before she swallowed it but girly decided to keep some in her mouth and then spat it out in a cup so she could plot how to get herself pregnant w it👩🏻‍🦯 dallas was funny at first and i thought she would be a strong fmc but as the story progressed i could not fucking stand her. i have never encountered a more annoying and childish fmc ever. her only character traits were: being a spoiled brat, sleeping, eating, spending money that’s not hers, and wanting to get knocked up. i hate when fmcs make their whole ENTIRE personality and their only goal in life about wanting kids or when they try to baby trap a mmc who doesn’t want any kids, like i was getting the ick. like girl chill pls, you’re only 21 and don’t even have a job or any prospects. also how did girly eat all these carbs but still managed to maintain a victoria’s secret model body?? 🤨 don’t get me started on romeo this man was fr a little bitch with severe daddy issues. the fmc has him acting like some brute. he’s obnoxious, stupid and rude to his staff - no but seriously he has NO respect for his staff whatsoever and treats them like they are gum on his shoe. he constantly calls the fmc lazy (i mean she was) but he also constantly insulted her intelligence and basically insinuated that she lacked education. i, for the life of me, can’t comprehend how these two will raise children when they still act like children themselves and the emotional maturity between them both is 5. i refuse to believe that they love each other, there’s just no way. their whole relationship gave me severe whiplash. like one minute he is saying “i will never love her” and the next chapter it’s “i love her so much” like huh?? did i miss some chapters or something bc wtf 💀now the spice omg, i truly have no words. i have never been put off by smut in my LIFE!! i hate the virgin/inexperienced heroine trope so much!! i blame RK for that bc the amount of times i've had to endure that trope with all her fmcs is INSANE me trying to figure out how the mmc broke the fmcs hymen just by eating her out:“i was no longer a virgin.” GIRL WDYM HE ONLY ATE YOU OUT LMFAOOOO PLS STOP THE MADNESS 😭😭 how can TWO female writers believe that a woman’s hymen can be broken by a man’s tongue.. like who tf is this guy…venom??? this felt like it was written by a 13 year old who just discovered what sex is. this man was so cautious about getting her pregnant and about contraceptive bc there’s still a high risk chance she can still get pregnant so in one scene they are literally having sex with their underwear still on but then throughout the rest of their honeymoon he fucks her through a bedsheet🧍🏻‍♀️“this was, by far the best fuck i’d ever had.” SIR STOP THE CAP- YOU BOTH STILL HAD UR UNDERWEAR ON.. IM CRYING HOW IS THIS BOOK EVEN REAL SKSJJSSJ “and every night, i fucked her through a bedsheet.”I WISH I WAS MAKING THIS SHIT UP 😭 how did he think this would be more preventative than wearing a condom?? i fear i have no brain cells left after reading this lmaoothank god i had rowan to suffer with bc it made the reading experience so much more fun. the way we both came to the realisation that we absolutely hated this book and it just ended up becoming a hate read but it also felt like a chore to finish 😭 both mmcs are the epitome of “dumb and dumber.” and i don't wish to suffer like that AGAIN.「 dark prince road series 」#1 — My Dark Romeo — 1 star #2 — My Dark Desire — 1 star",1
"520","123008168","2 generous stars bc algeria was mentioned😗only spoilers !!!there’s so much to unpack and i don’t know where to begin. i think the first point that irritated me was the writing and i kept wondering how can a co-written book be so mediocrely orchestrated with juvenile and unrealistic dialogues. it had to be satirical. IT HAD TO. ""Romeo’s penis could cure depression.""""He wanted it in my mouth? I’d hardly be able to fit the thing into my suitcase. Maybe Morgan had broken things off because he’d sprained her jaw with it."" ""Remember—tonight, you are a well-bred woman."" second, how in only the first chapter the fmc dumped all the ""luxury"" brands imaginable and she wouldn’t shut up about it. yeah, you’re rich WE GET IT KAREN.third, how some aspects of the storyline were without contest inspired from 'The Duke and I ' and the authors didn’t even try to hid it because Bridgerton was mentioned here and there and the fmc kept comparing the mmc to a ""duke"". The mmc didn’t want kids for only one reason; daddy issues, ofc🙄 and the fmc was literally desperate to have kids. he didn’t want to fuck her at first and then didn’t want to finish inside her, yeah *sigh*. she cried when she got her period obv wasn’t pregnant and even thought about using his cum when he finished inside her mouth and GET PREGNANT with it. 
  ""But leaning against my sink, observing the white thing swimming in the small cup, something prevented me from doing it. My morals, maybe.""
thank god she had morals just imagine she HADN’T.no one warned me that this book had satanic rituals because how can someone perfectly sane open his wound let the blood rain abundantly on his partner while fucking her from behind and then just :
  ""  More crimson drops splattered onto her back. I’d reopened my wound, and fresh red painted her spine. I dipped a finger into it, then spelled my name across her back dimples. “Who owns your ass?” I growled. “You.” “Louder.” “You.” “Now crawl forward and show me your cunt from behind. I want to see if it’s worth my cum. ""
yup, you read it right. the freaking psycho wrote his name with his blood on her back TO CLAIM HER. i don’t know if blood is a kind of kink but if it is im literally judging anyone who gets off because of it and when i tell every freaking smut scene involved BLOOD. and let’s not forget how they fucked and he was literally INSIDE HER WITH CLOTHES BETWEEN THEM. how she kept begging him to fuck her at every chapter, literally every chapter.last thing, how the storyline kept going and going and going and going like, all i was thinking was MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP. obviously, it didn’t and i absolutely hated how they tried so hard to paint the mmc as a ""tormented hero"" it sounded like a bad version of a telenovella where the hero always goes through so much to obligate the telespectator to feel sorry and with each dump trauma he didn’t want to shut up, he kept dumping and dumping and dumping and don’t forget that he kept COMING and COMING and COMING, i didn’t see the end of it.""I was so jealous of the orphans."" pls stfu was my reaction. there’s sm other HORRIBLE POINTS to highlight but i already have a migraine from what i wrote.~~~~~~~~~~we wanted to laugh.. we barely did🥲 rtc when the review slump is not slumping anymore ~*~*~*~*~buddy read with my twin lulu. wow look at us reading dArK rOmAnCe",2

Tbh this book was just not really for me mainly because I really disliked the male love interest for a huge chunk of the book. In general, alphahole male love interests aren't super my thing. Love me a morally grey man but for my personal taste, Romeo bordered on cruel & rude for the first half.I'm glad I finished it and didn't DNF it tho!

  Dallas Townsend
 — She's quick-witted, smart-mouthed, sweet, and sassy. She's obsessed with food, read smutty novels the whole day, is a virgin & hates studying! same girl same 😴
  Romeo Costa
 — He's mean & cold. He has dry humor, is close to a virgin because he did not have sex in 5 years, and is on a revenge quest to destroy his father's company. SUPER POSSESSIVE!
  Ruined by Shortbread.
Their first interaction had me cracking up. At an event, she went to his table just to get some shortbread that was only served to him, and they got into an argument! They later danced together, where he offered her to have a little hook-up with him including shortbreads and guess what SHE AGREED. It was supposed to be a random hookup for her but Romeo had other intentions. He laid a trap for her and she falls right into it. They hooked up in front of everyone, which Dallas was unaware of, creating a big scandal for her. Romeo took advantage of the situation and offered her dad a deal so he could marry her and steal her from his Rival aka her ex-fiancee. I hated her father for agreeing so easily. The town had an 18th-century mindset while living in the 21st century. The girls were virgins & had arranged marriages. IT WAS ALL BS & HER FATHER WAS A LOSER. I liked how she stood up for herself and her father got better in the end.
  
    I cannot, for the life of me, resist your temptation.
  
It's a slow burn. But they had a lot of sexual tension from the beginning. He found her beautiful and she constantly gave him a hard-on. While, he found her annoying, messy, and childish through 90% of the book, he was attracted to her. 
  HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY WITH HIS TONGUE.
 The first sex scene came after 50% of the book tho.
  
    I’d long suspected my wife was what Gen Z ridiculously referred to as a bad-ass bitch.
  
This was so true. She was so sassy that I loved her. Lmao, she was lazy & was always eating (it was mentioned in each & every chapter 🤣) but she was nice. She was sweet & became friends with the beautiful cook in Rom’s house instead of feeling jealous. I loved how she wasn't obsessed with Romeo or horny every time (well mostly). OVERALL SHE WAS RELATABLE SERIOUSLY and It's really hard to find a relatable character. She took no bullshit from Romeo, always did what she wanted, made him apologize so many times, spend 700k $ in a single day just because he wasn't spending time with her, and threw a party inviting every person from the list of people he blacklisted. She wasn't a brat completely lol, she even realized that she hadn't done anything to please him at all too. Seriously I can write a lot about her. 
  
    It sickened me to see someone so unsophisticated hold so much power over me.
  
All the things he did for her 😭. He offered to buy her the Japanese cookie factory because she wanted their cookies, bought a whole restaurant to kick her ex-fiancee out, bought a whole bookstore for her, gifted her books, stood in a long line in the cold to get her favorite Henry Plotkin’s book, took her for a food tour to the countries she wanted to visit, turned the whole house into a library because she wanted it. as Zach said & I quote ”pussy whipped”😂🥺. Although he was mean and said hurtful things but he wasn't that bad and I didn't get any cold vibes from him. He listened & respected her. - meanwhile Dallas:”You’re rich. We get it.” She yawned. “The only billionaires I like are fictional.” I felt bad for him after reading about his Trauma & anxiety! 
  
    Ruined by whipped cream.
  
Okay, this scene was so gross! very gross but I'll still mention it.🤣She seduced him and  tied him to her bed and put whipped cream all over his dick & chest and left him there all night. Sjhshshahahjshs 💀💀💀I knew where it was going and I still read it She also used the same words he used the night of the scandal ^ 👏🏻
  Zach Sun & Oliver VB:
His friends had a lot of scenes in this book! I swear I’ll kill for Zach’s book! His whole personality intrigued me so much. He’s emotionless, heartless & super intelligent. He loves art, has dry humor & always stall dates his mom arranged for him to find a suitable wife. Overall the authors knew we’d want to know his story. Meanwhile, Oliver is an open book. He’s the complete opposite of Zach. He fucks all the time. But ig he’ll be with Franklin (Dallas’ sister) because after seeing her at Rom’s wedding he always asked about her 😂 Their group chat was really funny. They both roasted Oliver again & again. It was so funny to see them calling Dallas different names like Detroit, Daytona, Denver, Decatur, or Davenport 🤣😭
  Why 3 stars rating:
• First of all, it was painfully long! 😭 If it could’ve been summed up in 300 pages, it would be perfect. I get that it was a slow burn but there were so many unnecessary things. • Morgan’s (Romeo’s ex) story was seriously unnecessary. What she did was so wrong and changed Romeo but it was just UNNECESSARY 🤷🏻‍♀️• Maddison's (Dallas’ ex-fiancee) role was as useless as Morgan’s. • Romeo Costa Sr 🤮💩 • Romeo’s whole family. 🤡💩 (His parents were literal copies of the Fitzpatricks)• *The next reason might give you cancer & you might never look at oreos the same way.* He imagined oreo cream as his cum as Dallas’ was licking it. 🤧😵‍💫🤧😵‍💫🫤😮😑😠• Romeo’s personality was inspired by Killian & Wolfe. His character wasn't original at all. 🫣• Dallas’ obsession with kids. I get it that you want them but at least respect your partner’s wish too.That’s a whole lot of reasons but hey it had amazing banter, dirty talking, cute moments & super possessive alpha moments too! 🤷🏻‍♀️✨",3

  ╰┈➤KITTY KATS CRAZY ABOUT BOOKS
༺ 𝗠𝗬 𝗗𝗔𝗥𝗞 𝗥𝗢𝗠𝗘𝗢 ༺ is a full length stand-alone. co-written by P. S Huntington and L.J. Shen. Spoken in 'dual perspectives.' Romeo Costa & (shortbread) aka Dallas Townsend. What started out as revenge, an arranged marriage turned into so much more...This Beauty and the Beast retelling was phenomenal and quickly came under a top read of 2023 for me. I have not giggled so much throughout a book like I did with this one, as soon as I started I was hooked, then the giggles erupted freely, the feels came quickly thereafter. And I never wanted it to end. Dallas & Romeo were perfection, complete opposites in every way! Twenty-one year old Dallas was sassy, knew what she wanted in life ( a baby above all else ) quick witted, and didn't give Romeo an inch. He pushed, she pushed harder. Thirty-one year old Romeo was an iceberg, but delve deeper and he had so many layers to him, he was ruthless, sought revenge, a complex man. This flowed ceaselessly, with it being co-written you couldn’t tell where one ended and the other started. Though I’ve got a feeling L.J. Shen’s wicked sense of humour shone throughout. The one liners that popped out of our heroines mouth were priceless making her one of my top female characters of all time. Her antics were hilarious, poor Romeo didn’t know what had hit him.

"530","123008168","I'm hoping Ms. Huntington had a major influence in the writing of this book or I'm going to go nuts. I have not been satisfied with the last few books that Ms. Shen has released, most have been very bleh and generic. They are far from her original books like ""Sparrow"" and ""Viscous"". I have high hopes for this book, so I guess we will see. Btw love the Amazon paperback cover, very old fashioned bodice ripper vibes.3/13/2023 update:DNF 23%. Y'all I'm mad bc this book is being mis-marketed. First of all, this is not a slow-burn enemies to lovers romance nor is it a dark romance as advertised. I would say this is more so if Adam Sandler tried to write a romance book. Which I mean would totally be fine if that is what it was advertised as! Then I wouldn't have spent my hard earned money on it and wouldn't have read it, since rom-com's with gross-out humor are not my thing! However, this was being advertised as some dark, tragic, Beauty and the Beast-esque type romance, which it was not! The FMC and MMC are immature and dumb and so are their families. I just couldn't with these two. They and their families acted like it was the year 1955. Oh man, Romeo had his hand down your panties at the debutant ball (happens 5% in)? I guess you have to marry the dude or we will be sent to social jail and lose all of our money and standing in society. Oh the horror?! I really didn't get it, Dallas doesn't even try to say or do anything about it, she just falls asleep watching Cheaters when he comes to take her away from her family. She doesn't even cry at not being able to say goodbye to said family! She was too busy watching Cheaters and falling asleep. Don't even get me started on Romeo, he was Shen's standard ""alphahole mega douche canoe"". Also can we get rid of the word ""alphahole""? It makes me cringe with a vengeance, I think it may be the most millennial thing out there besides the side-part and the phrase ""yolo"". When some one calls another person an alphahole, it doesn't sound sexy, it sounds like butt hole (to each their own). Romeo was pretty much a discount Killian from Shen's ""The Villain"". Big, hunky, businessman who hates everything cute or anything consider feminine/female. They both have father's who give them the marriage ultimatums and have a no p@ssy pact bc someone from their past cheated on them or hurt them in some way. They both have jobs at companies that are bad for society in some way, Killain runs a major oil company and Romeo is CFO of an military/arms dealing company. ""The Villain"" was marketed as HadesxPersephone while this book was marketed as BeautyxBeast. Ngl I'm tired of Shen recycling plots at this point. I could go on and on about this book, but I will spare who's ever reading this (if you have gotten this far). If you want to read something like this, but better go read Huntington's ""Darling Venom"" or ""Devious Lies"". If you like Shen more go read ""The Kiss Thief"" which is this, but done better. Oh yeah ""The Kiss Thief"" is if Romeo was more heartless and didn't have friends and actually carried out a decent revenge plot.Side-note: I can't believe Huntington wrote any of this, her stories are a lot more detailed and have actual likeable characters that aren't caricatures of people. I know people think Huntington and Shen are possibly the same person, but they can't be based off the way they write their characters. Huntington's characters have depth and Shen's ( as of late) do not. I've shed tears over some of the scenes in Huntington's stories, and I have not ever done that with one of Shen's. The other thing that left a bad taste in my mouth is that it seems like Shen's works are geared towards making her stories money mills. Like give the MMC a few friends and make them vaguely interesting enough to the point where they can have their own books and people will come back for more. It just seems like Shen is interested mostly in money than creating meaningful or impactful stories. I don't mind waiting 2 years for a Huntington book, if it's actually good. I don't know what this was, but I would advise against doing another team up like this in the future unless Huntington is more involved in the writing process.",1

She had potential, but the authors ruined it by making her weak and non-reactive.The whole wanting to be a mother thing was annoying to begin with, because... like ew.But she actually never did anything to show us how deep she really wanted that. Just kept saying she wanted it and had one scene where she went crazy over some couple's child.I didn't care.Hero told us a few times how he ""desired, wanted"" the heroine, but we never actually SAW that.Show Don’t Tell is pretty much the first thing writers learn in writing school, but these 2 authors said, ""fuck that noise. We will TELL exclusively.""Now, the humor in this book deserves some props. Some parts had me chuckle, I have to admit.I also didn't mind the pop culture references as much as some of the other reviewers I've seen complain about it. Although this will date this book exponentially. This book mentioned The Fall of Twitter, Kpop concerts/bands, Elon Musk among other current things, and as much as these are funny NOW, they won't be relevant 3 to 5 years from now and the humor will be kind of gone/outdated lmao.But other than the decent humor, I regret listening to this.Also what was with the backwards town where the heroine is from where the women had to stay virgins until marriage...? It felt so out of place in this supposedly ""modern"" story with this ""mordern"" heroine?",1

I just loved everything about it. Dallas and Romeo were total opposites. She was messy, lazy, and unorganized, (I honestly related to her at times 🤣) while Romeo thrived on cleanliness and order. It was fun watching him fall for her though. I really loved them together ❤️🫶🏻. I laughed out loud a few times at their banter. Their hate for each other had me giggling and wanting to read more! I loved it when she tied him to the bed! 😆🤭 I was smiling my ass off! Romeo was rude as hell but I really ended up loving him by the end. He was an alphahole and his possessiveness/jealousy was hot af 🥵. I also loved that towards the end, Romeo thought Dallas didn’t love him but he was willing to give her all of his love anyway. I just found that so sweet 🥺❤️. And how he stood in line for hours in the cold to get her a signed copy of her favorite book 🥺🫶🏻❤️. He was an asshole but he was sweet too. This did have a lot of pop culture references but it didn’t bother me enough for me to not enjoy the book. Overall, this was just a fun and easy read for me 👍🏼.",5

"542","123008168","This book was so ridiculous, and I think I will understand any negative review that I see about it, but I am rating it 5-stars out of sheer enjoyability. I had so much fun reading this - it was really funny. If you like dark romance, marriage of conveniences/arranged marriage tropes, extremely possessive alpha men, and books with lots of triggers, then give it a try. This book is the perfect level of hate-to-love. These characters really fucking hated each other, and I loved how the FMC was trying to get him to dump her for the first half of the book. I liked the FMC a lot; she was a bit immature so I can see people being annoyed by her, but she cracked me up. The writing was a bit choppy at times; sometimes I was confused how characters got from emotion A to emotion B. For example, when Dallas leaves the weapons test site all sad/feeling bad for what she did to Romeo, but then when he comes home, she's mad at him and forcing him to apologize. I couldn't keep up with the whiplash of emotions/how quickly attitudes or dialogue topics would randomly change in some scenes. However, this book was generally really funny and everything you would want in a ""lighter"" dark romance. The story is a bit like a mafia romance, but not exactly since no one was in the mafia, but it has same vibes. The one thing that drove me crazy and gave me the ick was all of the banter from Oliver about how much he wants to have sex with Dallas's younger sister, Franklin, and then all of Oliver's friends were like ""she's a literal teenager."" I know he's supposed to be a playboy character but joking about wanting to hook up with a child is just never funny to me. It was especially strange because Franklin is 19-years-old and she's not really underage or a child, so I was like, why do they need to keep joking about pedophilia? It's even more icky because the authors seemed to be setting up for a future book about Oliver and Franklin, and I'm like, can we not? (Franklin is moving into Romeo's penthouse in DC since she's kicked out of school, so she'll be around Romeo's friends aka Oliver). ....Yeah, I'm going to pass on that one... I might try Zach's book though, depending on the premise. This is by no means a masterpiece, but I gobbled this shit up.",5
"543","123008168","I would rather carve out my eyeballs with a plastic spoon than ever have to read the line “is this what I do with my pee pee?” in a romance book. STRAIGHT TO JAIL FOR THE AUTHORS.",1
"544","123008168","i could name a few poisons i would rather take then to ever know this book existed",1
"545","123008168","I'm Literally only reading this for Parker S Huntington. I Gave up on Lj Shen as a writer. Now let's hope Lj doesn't bring parker down with this one. I heard theory that people believe Parker could have been Lj's Ghost writer in the past, and honestly, I sort of believe it.Okay, Star rating will probably change as I go. So far, I don't hate it, but the things that are bringing my rating down, is definitely the writing that is heavily Lj Shen influenced. Lj has a way of writing over the top characters that are almost a cartoon version of the type of person she is trying to portray. She writes in a way that feels almost outside of reality. The way they talk is unlike the way anyone else does. What she thinks is high class is awkward, and makes it feel like a comedy. If you come at it from the perspective that it is a comedy, you definitely start enjoying it more. Update: Okay I am about 30 percent… once we get past the heavily influenced Lj writing, and overuse of pop culture references in the first 20 percent… the plot does really pick up. I genuinely am liking the heroine. Because of the way she’s got a backbone. The hero is your typically cold and closed off Lj hero… but unlike many of her heroines… this one gives it back to him… there's a scene that had me screaming, “hell yes! “Because finally one of these heroines has a backbone! Because of the heroine so far and this scene, I’ll move it up to a 4 star… I’m going to say this was a Parker writing decision. Haha Ill update as I go....Bringing my rating back down because it's been days and I haven't gotten back to it. Ugh....",3
"546","123008168","4.75 ⭐️ 3🌶️This book was sooo much better than I expected!First off the writing is great, it’s quick, funny, the banter is top notch and the book or story never felt dragged out. Perfect length for a standalone romance (none of this 500 pages rubbish just for a couple to get together lol)Romeo was written to perfection, I loved his character, grumpy, troubled billionaire. His personality was extremely fleshed out I loved him. his friends the side characters also had enough great personalities too. I like when they don’t get left out, brings so much more dimension to the book. Dallas is the MOST RELATABLE fmc ever! I loved her- obsessed with food and snacking, I love how she was just so unapologetically herself, and didn’t care about trying to fit into this society that she’d grown up in. This is probably the best forced marriage/marriage of convenience I’ve read in a WHILE!The tension 🤌🏼 the angst 🤌🏼 the banter 🤌🏼 the spice 🤌🏼I want a Romeo Costa 😅❤️",5
"547","123008168","Dnf at 40%. Words such as ""let me taste your juices"" and phrases like 'he looked at me like i was flaming poop' and a fmc who's over 18 and still wont say the F word. The way these authors are able to make a smutty romance novel feel like it was written by a 13 year old who just discovered what s*x is astounds me. truly something that takes work to achieve. i might even applaud such a feat if i didn't have to read 'he had my hymens blood on his mouth' as if insinuating his tongue was long enough to- anyway i digress.",2
"548","123008168","I didn't expect to love this as much as I did, but when we learned about Romeo's past!?!? I love a damaged hero and that made me love him more. He's also a very protective and obsessive hero and will tear anyone apart who touches Dallas. And I loved how they clashed when they first got married and how Dallas would do anything to drive him crazy. But then, despite what they both wanted, they both fell so hard for each other.This was just such a fun and entertaining time, and that's what I'm basing my rating on. Plus Jacob Morgan narrates the audio!? Perfection.",4
"549","208415817","2.99 stars. A rapist? With the virginity kink?? As a love interest??? In a college romance book???? ... ... ... ... ... I'm so underwhelmed. So scandalized. I'm yet to see anyone complain about how toxic, patriarchal and despicable that kind of thing is. Hey... hello... is anybody here?? Are moral police on vacation??? Why are y'all so boring and call the guy who forced a blowjob on the suicidal con artist hot/bland/soft/adorable when you could be having the time of your lives gaslighting readers for romanticizing the harmful behavior right about... now? How weird.  Every time RK releases a new book, I'm ecstatic, regardless of the outcome, because I always get the feeling in my gut that tells me  And my gut feeling fails me all the time. But not when it comes to RK. 😈
  The writing
 1) Not the flashbacks from my Wattpad past. 😭😂
  
    The air frizzles my honey-colored hair that’s streaked with natural blonde balayage and stuffs it in my eyes. 
  
Not the ""I look in the mirrow. The reflection of a stunningly beautiful girl with golden specks in her dark green eyes that match her long, honey-coloured hair stares right back at me"" little speech. 😭Rina, blink once if a Wattpad author is holding you hostage.2) RK's dramatic flair for doom and gloom is actually leaking out of this book's every orifice, I kid you not:
  
    Every time I close my eyes, Devlin’s kind face comes crashing in, then he smiles as scarlet red explodes from all of his orifices. 
  
📘o r i f i c e📘noungiven context: smut bookexamples of word usage in sentences: Irunia, humorously (naughty giggling bursting out of her orifi mouth): Killian was stuffing his cum into Glyndon's every available orifice.Rina Kent, formally, pompously (a melodramatic catch in her breath): SCARLET FUCKING RED EXPLODES FROM ALL OF HIS ORIFICES.— is someone's tragic death (or lack thereof) supposed to sound that funny? Asking for a friend, I'm not even complaining. Unintentional comedic relief, even taking the form of Devlin's death, is always welcome. 
  
    I flip it back and rub my palm on the side of my shorts as I stare down.Down.Down…My rubbing heightens in intensity and so does the sound of the wind and the waves in my ear.
  
I stare up.Up.Up.Up. (you see, I love me some parcellation as a stylistic device too)At the starless. Soulless. Sparkless. Sky. My laughing heightens in intensity and so does the poetic quality of Miss Kent's writing. 😂 That first chapter had me howling with how edgy and dramatic it endeavoured to appear: crashing waves, bloody images rolling with the wrecking force of a hurricane, haunting scratch of metal and deadly water. Wow, I felt almost haunted.💀💀💀💀
  
    No stars were present then either, and just like tonight, the moon shone brightly, like the bleeding of pure silver on a blank canvas. The immortal rocks are unassuming witnesses of crimson blood, lost life—and an all-encompassing sense of grief.
  
The immortal rocks didn't agree to the whole 'unassuming witnesses of crimson blood and lost life' ordeal, but whatever. If that's not peak poetry, I don't what is.  Eventually, the writing style smoothens out a little bit, but here and there RK has a pompously worded phrase ready for describing someone's death, suicide attempt or inferiority complex. Maybe because she is operating under the misapprehension that otherwise readers will be unmoved by the simple beauty of tragedy itself? Who knows. Certainly not us.It's not the first time that I've noticed that RK makes her characters assume opulently a robe of exalted passions and exceptional emotions for the sake of drama and angst. I'd be more annoyed if it weren't so unintentionally funny. That's why, having clowned her wannabe poetry from the top to the bottom, I digress.
  Killian (H)
Callous. Cold-blooded. Ice-cold. Lifeless. Monster. Psychopath.— So often have RK Glyndon and Killian tried to make themselves as well as others believe Killian is a psychopathic being never intended for normal society and doomed to misunderstanding that they have effectively convinced themselves of it. Not me though. I'm very sceptical of authors who tell not show feel the need to remind a reader of the same damn thing every 10 pages as if we were idiots incapable of coming to our own conclusions based on character's actions. The only remotely unhinged scene that Killian performed quite well was their first meeting with Glyndon, where he gave her a choice of ""blow me or die 👹👺👹👺"".
  
    “I can always use your ass and cunt. In that order. So unless you’re willing to soak my dick with your blood and lick it clean, I suggest you open your mouth.” He hits me across the lips with his dick and I have no choice but to loosen my jaw.
  
That was hot, considering how Killian almost let her fall off the ""deadly"" cliff in the embrace of the ""immortal"" rocks sksksksk. 
  
    “Please use your lips or please use your cunt and ass?” He pauses, then pushes me backward until my upper half is tilted in the cliff’s direction. “Or please turn you into a masterpiece?”
  
Otherwise, Killian is such an adorable little cinnamon roll. 🥺🔪🥺 Melted my cold-blooded heart.
  
    “You’re drunk, I’ll take your shots.”
  
 Or more like a parody of a real psychopath. He is reminiscent of an edgy emo boy who happened to read an article ""20 Signs of a Psychopath: Traits & Characteristics - Choosing Therapy"" and conformed his behavior to the global standards for psychopaths: all the signs match, but that doesn't make him one. When Killian discards his supposedly psychopathic role, as in when he's too busy preparing meals for Glyndon, stalking her social media or subscribing to art magazines, Killian can be so fucking amusing and natural. <3 
  
    “No. You’re not my type.”He pauses before stroking my stomach again. “And what’s your type?”“Someone nice.”“I can be nice.”“Yeah, right.”His voice lowers to a shiver-inducing range. “I gave you time like you asked, and it was a stretch on my part since, and I repeat, I am not a giver. So if that’s not considered nice, maybe I should retract my promise and be the opposite of nice.”“Don’t…” This arsehole is a major headache. I can never win against him.“Does that mean I’m nice?”“You can be,” I mutter.“Look at that. I’m suddenly your type.” I glare up him and I’m met with a low chuckle. “You’re so adorable, I could eat you up.”
  
Comedy king. My little cutie pie. 💕
  
    I run back to my notifications and find he liked a lot of my pictures. I scroll down and down, and holy hell, the crazy bastard liked all five hundred pictures I posted on Instagram.Every single one.An hour ago.
  
You mean to say he's not boyfriend goals? 🔪🔪🔪
  
    He cups my jaw then uses a finger to wipe across my bottom lip. “I love your mouth when it’s stuffed with my cock. You’re my perfect little cum hole, aren’t you?”
  
 Killian better have Glyndon's number stored in his phone as ""My Perfect Little Cum Hole"". 😌 
  Glyndon (h)
 aka his perfect little cum hole 💕Surprisingly, I liked Glyndon despite her being a very formulaic heroine whose inferiority complex serves as her one and only flex in this life. Sometimes she came up with funny lines that had me chuckling. 
  
    Killian’s expression remains blank, so she steps toward him, swaying her hips and biting the corner of her lower lip. “How about a celebratory fuck to welcome me to the Heathens? You can choke me.”I step backward as if I’ve been slapped. I can’t stay here anymore. My chest aches at the thought that he’s done the things he did to me to someone else.He choked them, too.
  
 I — 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 How can anyone hate Glyndon?I wish my only problem in life was me realizing my boyfriend choked other girls before me meanwhile I was living under the illusion that the whole choking thing was exclusive between us. 👉🏻👈🏻 Imagine the heartbreak. 💔 Honestly, I keep reading RK for one reason only: her characters are so unintentionally funny.Also don't tell me RK turned her heroine into a sweet princess that secretly harbors a rape fantasy inside her little head?? How convenient. 😂 I thought we already had that crap in Naomi × Seb book??? Not another fucking bitch in the parody of a dark romance confessing to always having fantasies about being forced to have sex. 😭😂😭😂Yes, I might be having a mental breakdown, live, on the air, especially if I have to read about a heroine who calls herself ""deviant"" for entertaining a rape fantasy and then enjoying it when the occasion comes, why you even askin'? Stop being a pussy and write a normal rape scene for once, they're not supposed to enjoy it sksksksks. 😭 Don't admit me to a mental asylum just yet.
  Filler dialogues

  
    “Do you like messing with people a lot?”“Not all people, no. Just a select few.”“So I’m a VIP now?”“If you want.”“Seriously, talking to you is like speaking to an evil robot.”“Evil robot, huh?”“Yeah, you know, the ones who get destroyed at the end of sci-fi films.”“You mean the ones whose red eyes flash in the last second of the movie, signaling their return?”“You shouldn’t be proud of being evil.”“That’s the thing, baby. I don’t see myself as evil.”“Please don’t tell me you see yourself as a hero.” She sounds even more spooked than earlier.“No, I don’t. I just see myself as neutral. Instead of black, white, or gray. I’m colorless.”“You’re an entity. You can’t be colorless.” She huffs. “You’re just black.”“Black?”“Yeah, I give people colors and you’re definitely black, like your soul, heart, and that disturbing head of yours.”
  
Is that a script for a new tiktok reel? 👁️👁️ The page count could have been cut down by 20% with no residual damage; beta and alpha readers — hey, what's up? On vacation too?
  Side characters
Unlike everybody and their mother, I don't care about any secondary characters.Well, okay.Maybe I do? Landon × Mia 💕Secondary characters and their interactions were mostly funny and entertaining (nothing to obsess over in my humble opinion though), but maybe RK should focus more on her main characters so that others don't steal their show? Like it happens in every damn book of hers. Or is that her marketing strategy aimed at luring people in reading her larger-than-life series, sequels, prequels and what not? 😂 Good soup.If you wanna read a quality book about an authentic rapey sociopath with the virginity kink, go ahead and download UntouchableUntouchable. No shadowing here. 🌚Overall: pretty mediocre, even for RK. Since I'm such a ray of sunshine exuding cheerful energy today, lemme finish this on a positive note: there's always something comforting and entertaining about RK books, equivalent to visiting an old friend. A wacky old friend. 💕",3
"550","208415817","➸  1.5 stars— did i devour this book? yes. is this the worst book i’ve read this year? also yes. i tried to read this book last year but dnfd after chapter 3 bc of the forced SA. ultimately, i wanted to give this book another go and i wish i didn’t, bc it got so much worse. i fr lost all my brain cells reading this book!! if i had to read the word “neurotypical” and “cunt” or calling women ""holes"" one more time i was going to fkn lose it. ➷ the way this story started out was criminally insane!! the mmc literally corners the suicidal fmc on the edge of a cliff and forces her to give him a blowjob or he was going to ✨push her off the cliff✨ who says romance is dead it’s then later on imposed that the forced sex scenes are non-con bc its one of the fmcs fantasies?? um okay, anyway - i truly have no words. i’m so tired of rk handling triggering topics so recklessly. DO BETTER!! and the way people romanticise their relationship is alarming, y’all be treating them like they are some cutesy hallmark couple just bc he goes all soft for her.. THE STANDARDS ARE DISGUSTINGLY LOW!! 😭 — leviastrid were the worst characters in the royal elite series so it makes sense that the fmc is astrid’s spawn bc glyn’s character was so utterly boring and she has the personality of a stick.. i don’t understand why killian was so fascinated and obsessed w her.. and naming her glyndon?? JAILLL 💀 (yes i still hold the biggest grudge towards astrid bc of how she treated my bby nicole)how i imagine killian and glyn when they argue:➳ killian is your typical emotionless, basic bitch ass edgelord, wannabe psycho who has ✨daddy issues✨ he is supposed to be this scary, threatening character but he isn’t one bit scary like he’s made out to be lmao. his character was downright cringy and the biggest loser who gave me the biggest ick. i refuse to believe he’s a psychopath when he made a smiley face with his food.. like ooh shiver me timbers, im so scared. also how is this man a med student?? UM ABORT ABORT ABORT, HE SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR PEOPLE ➷ i felt no chemistry between killian and glyn whatsoever. the dialogue felt juvenile and the writing was deadset comical, i felt like i was reading something that was written by a 7th grader. and the sex scenes were atrocious, like the anal scene?? wtf do you mean she cries “tears of relief” when he rams it in her with no preparation sksjdjs PLSS LETS BFFR RN. i honestly had the blankest face reading the smut scenes bc they were the most cringiest, unrealistic shit ever written. this is honestly a run down of what their convos consisted of:↳ “dirty little slut” “tight little cunt” “blood coats my dick” gagging 🤢↳ glyn: I HATE YOU 😤↳ killian: STOP PROVOKING ME BEFORE I TAKE YOUR VIRGINITY AND STUFF YOU WITH MY CUM 👹↳ “say you’re mine.” “no.” ↳ “fuck you.” “oh, baby. you know that foul little mouth gets me hard.”— glyn honestly has no willpower and lets killian do whatever he wants to her and she just accepts it with little to no fight.. girly needed to go back to therapy fr. — nikolai is the only character who piqued my interest in this book. long hair, tatted and has his dick pierced?? on my knees barking rn. y’all don’t understand how excited i am for niko & bran’s book,, NIKO CALLING BRAN LOTUS FLOWER?? BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIA PRINCE X SOFT, SHY GOLDEN RETRIEVER BOY?? IM SEATED. i literally felt more tension between both of these characters compared to the main leads in this book - THEIR BOOK WILL BE MY JOKER!! ALSO MISS RK PLEASE STOP WITH THE SAME OLD “VIRGIN HEROINE” TROPE. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, IM TIRED!! THE COPY AND PASTE OF COUPLES FROM PREVIOUS BOOKS IS GETTING SO BORING, GIVE US SOMETHING NEW!! anyways even tho this book SUCKED, i will solemnly be continuing on this series for landon, eli & nikolai only 🤭",1

"555","208415817","3 starsi can't believe this book surpassed Aiden's trilogy (actually, i can because that was a shitty trilogy). Booktok really made this series famous.🫣
  ➤ KILLIAN CARSON:

  Rina really tried to give him depth by adding 'Daddy Issues' to his psycho, dark, animalistic, serial killer personality.
he's extremely rude and a psycho (obvious). a 19-year-old teenager, in his 4th year of pre-medical studies — at KING'S U University — with his psycho friends! He's obsessed with Glyndon from when he forced her to give him a blowjob while she was dangling from the edge of a cliff and seconds away from cracking her skull open! 💀Killian literally went 🚶‍♂️🤝🏻 📸 *Click* 📸 and was like, mhmjmmm nice picture..... continue.
  ➤ GLYNDON KING:

  'A king never bows', but babe... you actually did.
No king ever lives up to their hype (edit: Eli and Landon King did), so I had no expectations at all for Glyndon! Glyndon was suicidal at the start because of her dead bestie, but after the blowjob, she was okay and didn't try to kill herself again.  She knew that she attracted a wannabe psycho, she kept comparing him with her brother. she did nothing except for throwing some words or sassying around (which earned her more FORCED bjs & kisses and she becomes boring again). Her insecurities could've given her character a depth, but they were brushed off. ngl, even i know that she was suffering from being 'the youngest' 😭 but things could've been better. Her relationship with landon isn't good throughout this book, and Rina didn't really try to mend it in his book either. It was always Landon & Brandon.╰┈➤ TOXIC RELATIONSHIP:• Their toxic relationship was so toxic that Killian used to make food for her because she didn't eat properly. He quit smoking for her. He killed someone who beat Glyndon. He threatened Glyndon repeatedly to take her virginity. He threatened her teacher who was never satisfied with her work.well these things were present but the focus was always on DARK, FORCED, PSYCHOPATHIC, DERANGED shit, which was making me furious because fgs stop this smut. I'm not really interested to read about you guys fucking 24/7. and, If a guy talks to your girl or even touches her, you should TALK first. If not, then talk with your fists a little but WITH THE GUY. Don't go around and taking virginities of your girls just because you see them talking to someone. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT YOU WHINY BITCH. ➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:• CreightonAnnika: I'm excited for their story! (update: they are the shittiest couple. Annika is 3/5 while Creigh is 0.1/5) • JeremyCecily: tbh i feel like they're kinda boring? (update: i was scared to read it but ended up LOVING this one sm! I love love love Jeremy & Cecily.)• LandonMia: though Lan's also A PSYCHO, and he's going to be as misogynistic as the others, I'm still waiting for his book, and the fact that Mia's his match is actually pretty cool! Let's see, fingers crossed. (update: copy of other books but great. reread it and loved it.)• NikolaiBrandon: are actually going to be the first MM romance I'm going to read! And Nikolai is unhinged, but he's pretty obsessed with Brandon, so let's see. (update: enjoyed the book, it was cute! )• EliAva: are babies! I loathe Aiden so much! I hated his books and I hated everything about him, but Eliava are the reasons I started this whole series. I have high expectations fr and idk why sometimes I try to force my brain to actually like a book because i have high expectations. It takes me some time to actually realize that I didn't actually enjoy it, so maybe that'll happen if Rina writes Eli as Aiden 2.0, but hopefully, they're not getting a trilogy, so THAT'S A WIN! (update: fucking devoured their book, I'm still crying, screaming, getting insanely emotional because their book ended. IT WAS FUCKING GOOD! The best one of this series and i love EliAva more than anyone.) • RemiAriella: are actually going to serve, I know that! It's in my veins unless Rina pulls a DanielNicole 2.0 and makes Remi an asshole! and the fact Ari stalks Remi ehheheh! (no book bitchass INJUSTICE).• nvm the other good characters like Maya, Vaughn and Gareth aren't getting their books either. ➤ FINAL THOUGHTS:I don't hate dark romance books, it's just that some scenes really piss me off. Being labeled with Dark doesnt mean that the author should throw connection, understanding, plot and accepting mistakes a little more, into the bin. New romance books glorify sexual assault way too much. In kidnapping books, i get it. In backstory, i get that too. BUT THE MAIN CHARACTER DOING ALL THIS SHIT? NO ✋🏻 (let him do nasty shit like burning the house or taking the business or EVEN being Verbal but why does it have to be Dub-con always?) I'm okay with dub con mostly because sometimes lol they do make sense for certain situations so a plot and great characters are necessary! A misogynist asshole with a girl with no backbone is getting pretty old!  By dark, the book is supposed to be dark, not THE RELATIONSHIP that it actually becomes unbearable to read.this book had some nice scenes, I'm not completely a hater lol. Glyn was pretty badass for posting two pictures on Instagram (holding hands w someone and a painting saying 'my type' with the type being completely opposite of Killian lol) 😂 and also for ghosting him but the vibes were ruined by forced scenes again and again. ASHER CARSON WAS BEING A PETTY BITCH, NO LIE! IF HE WAS SO PISSED AT HIS SON, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE FUCKED REINA WITHOUT A GODDAMN CONDOM 🤌🏻

(and the way all of these are within the first few chapter... i could have written a thesis with the amount of quotes there were)
  Her skin appears pale blue in the darkness, like fresh corpses. If she somehow starts bleeding and the red is added to the mix, her skin will look ethereal under the moon.Once upon a time, I was plagued by the urge to see underneath animals’ skin. Humans, too, but I only had access to animals.See what exactly lurks behind that thunderous pulse, the soft beauty and the translucent skin? I bet red will make her a masterpiece.What I didn’t realize, however, is the level of release I could have with her. It’s similar to that first time I cut open the mice and saw what was inside them. It’s the thrill of possessing someone’s life between my fingers.“Did you bring a lot of your victims here?”“So that’s what you are now, my victim? I like that.”
creepy. weird. stinky. stale. pervy. disturbed. boring. snoozefest. tedious. flat. you’d think a psychopathic rapist would have some ✨zest✨ to him? but no. i know for a fact this motherfucker smells funky and has greasy bangs. and that when he was in school he ran like thisif you’re gonna give me a psychopath with an affinity for killing things, at least make him hot, mysterious, domineering, suave, witty... not this greasy weirdo who deffos lurks around the bins at school. the best part of this book was him getting kidnapped and beaten by my bby Landon🤗 Glyndon “perfect little cum hole” King:all you need to know is that her mother is my arch-nemesis and Glyndon is as fucking dull as her. i truly don’t know why Killian was obsessed with her nor why/how she got over him raping and assaulting her so quickly. he even says “I swear to fuck this seemingly normal, innocent, fucking boring-on-paper girl might not be boring or normal, after all.”no babes, dw, you got it right the first time! Annika:my beloved🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️the star of the show. the loml. my lil cutie i adore her, eurghhhh.Creighton:Cecily:idk why i picture her as Felicity Smoak but she just has that vibe and she served it well. loml 2.0Ava:my pink bubblegum princess, ily. i know her and Eli are gonna serve so fucking hard.Remi:i have finally come to the conclusion that RK can’t be British because if she was, she’d know that if Remi really went to a British school/uni, he’d get bullied so severely he’d contemplate killing himself at the end of each day. inaccurate British representation😔💔Bran:my gaydar never fails me💅🏻 Lan: definitely my favourite sociopath up in here!! there were many of them too... but he took the cake🥺Eli:not mad about it👀Nikolai:id like to formally apologise to this man for comparing him to Remi😔🥲 you didn’t deserve that shit, bby.Jeremy and Gareth... ehhhh. don’t think we saw enough of them for me to deduce an opinion yet. Jeremy definitely intrigues me, even though him and Gareth feel very similar. so to sum it all up... the OG characters all fucked up in raising their kids💀 i don’t think a single one of them is mentally stable whatsoever. although the families and their drama were the highlight of the book for me, so. 
  the couples i want!!
 ⟡ Annika and Creigh... i will go feral if i don’t get these two.⟡ Jeremy and Cecily OR Jeremy and Landon... hear me out! rivals to lovers. the rival leaders of the Elites and the Heathens???? falling in love? yes🤲🏻⟡ Remi and a castration ❤️⟡ Eli and Ava ⟡ Landon and Mia ????? 👀👀⟡ i always wanted Bran and Jay (Nicole’s brother) but im assuming it’ll be Nikolai and im really not mad about it. despite disliking this first book, RK really has me intrigued for the rest.",2

  Thoughts
I surprisingly ended up enjoying this more than I thought I would. I went in with the lowest expectation ever and I´m glad they didn´t become reality. Y´all know I´m not the biggest fan of rape kink, but idk what happened during this book that made me not like it but also not feel disgusted. 
  Romance
Killian and Glyn match each others freakiness so well, they were everything but a healthy couple, but you know they suit each other in that aspect. I feel like before they met each other they were just two empty and lonely souls who breathed but weren’t actually alive. I’m glad they found each other despite all the crazy things that happend between them.
  “I stare at her for a beat and then smile. Jesus. This girl is getting herself into big fucking trouble. Because I want to keep talking to her. And I don’t even like talking to people.”

  Characters
⤷Glyndon: She’s sweet, though she can be a bit annoying at times. I felt bad for her constantly comparing herself to her brothers when it came to art, she felt so insecure bc her art was different from her brothers and mom and thats just sad. The cutest thing about her was her bond with Jonathan, he was so soft and caring when it came to her, and I couldn´t help but feel all giggely when I saw them together. The only request I have for Glyn is to knock off the Landon hate bc girl you literally love someone worse than him, be for real. I haven´t even read Landon´s book but my pookie Buket loves him and thats enough reason for me. ⤷Killian: I surprisingly ended up liking him more than I thought I would. Killian was indeed a psycho, but he had a way of making every little normal bare minimum act feel like a refreshing ‘oh he can be a decent person’. At this point he wasn´t only gaslighting and manipulating Glyn, he was getting to me too. I wish Rina made Asher grovel for hurting Killian so much, that he felt like he was less than others. 
  Writing
Rina has quickly become one of my comfort authors, and it makes me sad that with each book I read, I’m getting closer to the end of her universe. Rina I still want Remi and Damien´s book I´m begging you. Her writing isn´t the best but it´s so easy and quick, she has a way of making me forget that I´m reading and I love that about her.

the way killian had to keep repressing himself from murdering glyn 😍🥰 his self-control is unmatchedi’m actually obsessed with the banter between killian and glyn. they had NO RIGHT being that funny, particularly killian though
  “I’ll have you know that my secondary school boyfriend had a huge dick.”“You said that to piss me off, didn’t you?”
please the scene where glyn tries to act like she’s not into killian because her ‘type’ is a nice guy, but kill is just like ‘well aren’t i considered nice because i’m not trying to fuck you right now’ “Does that mean I’m nice?”“You can be,” I mutter.“Look at that. I’m suddenly your type.”
as far as the plot goes, it didn’t really exist and what there was, wasn’t anything too interesting to be honest. the conflict at the end could have been avoided if killian just told glyn the truth, instead of hiding it and looking even more suspecti also didn’t really care about the chapters in astrid, levi, and asher’s POVs (astrid and levi are glyn’s parents while asher is kill’s dad). i suppose me not really caring about their chapters had to do with me not having read their books, but if you’ve read them, you might really enjoy those chapters.CREIGHTON x ANNIKA & NIKOLAI x BRAN ARE GONNA BE SO GOOD, I FEEL IT IN MY BONESremi was so fucking annoying. why did he keep blurting out that’s he’s a ‘lordship’ and calling creigh ‘spawn’ it still stands that the only remi i can stand is remi for ratatouille 🐀

Want to read about a psycho who becomes obsessed quickly? How about one who has a low moral compass? Who doesn’t know how to feel sympathy? Well, then you came to the right spot… cause Killian is all of this… and more 😅(his name is so fitting lol). If you get triggered easily, then this might not be the book for you. The first scene can be tough for people (I’ll list ⚠️ down below). As for me, well, that only solidified how crazy, OTT, and psycho Killian is… and… I was glued to the pages 😬. 
   “You’ll be late anyway, so how about we go back to my very logical idea of staying in bed all day?” I stare at Killian from my position in the passenger seat of his car. “Are you kidding?” He taps his finger on the steering wheel. “It’s strange how I rarely joke, but you choose to think that anyway. We need to work on your denial issues.”
Glyndon (19) is visiting the site of where her close friend unal!ved himself. She’s having some thoughts about life herself when she’s feeling like she’s falling. Don’t worry. Killian (19) comes to save the day. Well, kind of 😬. He’s not saving her without getting something in return, and he wants her to beg and get on her knees 😬. But she doesn’t want to. She’s a King, and Kings don’t bow down- she has the bite to prove it 😬, but Killian is gonna make her… and he’s gonna love every second of it 😅🫣. What I liked/loved: (possible spoilers)—umm… I wasn’t gonna say this first, but I’ll say it. The 🔥 lol. There’s a lot of it 😬😅. Once Killian takes Glyndon’s v at about 50%, it’s on 😉. I’m surprised these two came up for air 🤣. I appreciated that he *respected* her feelings here and there… until he was tired of being *respectful*—how, um, f0rceful Killian could be. He doesn’t like the word no 👀. If he wants something, he’s gonna take it 😬. The opening scene is n0nc0n, then we get some dubc0n ones, but for the most part, Glyndon was along for the ride 😉
  “I don’t want to be your girlfriend. In fact, I don’t want to be your anything.” “Good thing you have no say in it.”
—how different Killian feels and is for Glyndon. Since he’s a certified psycho, he gets surprised with himself at how obsessed he becomes with her and any type of emotions he feels for her. He’s never cared for girls, never had girlfriends, never wanted to be in a relationship, and, well, now he does 💁🏻‍♀️. She might say no, but he doesn’t care 😂. They’re together whether she likes it or not 🙃—how duuuurty his mouth is 🥵. Are you kidding me Killian? How dare you be this good? You have no business being such a f!lthy speaking 19 year-old 💦. Good LAWD. Save my kindle. Killian has spoken and it’s gonna melt 🔥—how OTT and JP Killian is. I mean. This man sees his woman getting near OM and he goes ape ish. I love me some jealous OM scenes, and this one is GOOD 😈💅
  ”Looks like I created a monster. Maybe we should explore your sexuality, after all.” “Exploring my sexuality means sleeping around, hooking up. You know, the casual kinky sex you had but I didn’t get the chance to try.” My smirk disappears. “If you’re up for fucking in their blood, then sure thing. You have the green light to pick some poor souls.” 
—the soft side of Killian. Yeah, I know. Seems weird, but he has some swoony moments. Not too many lol but considering he’s not well versed in sweet or nice, I was pleasantly surprised —the side characters. I found myself taking notes as to who was doing what and who’s kid was whose and what family did what 🤣. I have to say, having read many of the books from the parents of the kids, I appreciated seeing their offsprings lol. I even noticed how similar certain kids were to their parents. I mean. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree 💅—Remi and his lordship was annoying, yet also hilarious omg. Reminds me of his dad 😂. He gets his own bullet (since he won’t be getting a book 😩 neither is Gareth 🥺 and a few other characters)—the text messages!!! Not only between the kids, but THE LAST TEXTING THREAD WAS SOOO SOOO GOOD! Sigh. Man. I’m feeling like I need to revisit RES. I was legit GIDDY and smiling !!!—the parents’ POV chapters. I need to read Killian’s parents’ duet, but I still got the gist —the rivalry stuff that’s happening. Obviously, there’s going to be an overarching storyline as the series progresses. I’m excited 🥰—potential couples 👀. I found myself analyzing all the interactions between characters as they were meeting. I’m soo excited for book 2 👏🏻—the ow stuff 😑. Now. If you’ve read my reviews, you know how much I hate it in my books, but in this one, I like how Killian puts the ow in her place. He stops her kisses and talks shit to her 💁🏻‍♀️. Sounds good to me 💅What I didn’t like/wanted more of:—when the tension between Killian and his family happens, I wanted it to be drawn out more. I got emotional, regardless, but I still wanted more —more sweet Killian. He actually makes an effort, but I would’ve liked to see them as a nice couple a little bit longer (like in an extended epilogue lol). I get it. We’ll get their HEA as the series continues, but I wanted more —there were some grammar/spelling mistakes. If the mistakes are minor, I tend to overlook them, but there were a couple that had me rereading lines to figure out what was supposed to be there 😬Overall, I pretty much loved it lol. It’s been a while since I read a good Rina Kent book, and this one hit all my spots 😉⚠️safety squad⚠️-no cheating/sharing -su!cid€/su!cid€ ideation/mental health -n0ncon/dubc0n -violence/bloodshed -breath play/ch0king/degradation kink/biting/marking/p slapping/a$$ play/an@l-OW kisses H.

This was so underwhelming and boring and RK out there bragging it's her longest book 🤣 (sorry hun, long =/= good).From the first chapter we get the words psychopath and sociopath thrown around and you know the characters are going to be either extra self-aware or just... caricatures of what a psychopath is supposed to be. On that note, Killian kept threatening her he'd fuck her and until 49% he NEVER DOES. You start nicely with a forced BJ and then he never does good on his other threats? He only molests her  a little  Yepp, that should tell you it falls into the latter category and it ended up being a caricature 🤡 some people are upset he assaulted her and here I am disappointed he didn't assault her enough ----------------------------Hot cover aside, why is the same person from  Pueblo Nuevo, 02, Panama  here 1 starring this with multiple accounts (the same who 1 starred Empire of Hate a thousand times)? 🤣",1

Glyn grew up in a family of sociopaths and artists. Her mother is a famous artist and her brothers Brandon and Landon are both artists as well, the latter being a sociopath like their Grandfather Jonathon and Uncle Aiden King. Glyn is also an artist, though she always felt like she didn’t add up. She keeps her emotions inside and after her best friend died a few weeks ago, she has been suffering in silence. The Anti-Hero: Killian Carson - he is American and son to Asher Carson and Reina Ellis. Killian is a true Psychopath in every way. He is a fourth year med student despite only being 19 and an amateur photographer, he likes to take pictures of very dark subject matter. Glyndon has caught his eye and once he is focused on something, he doesn’t let up. The Story: Glyn and Killian meet at the edge of a cliff and suffice it to say, they do not meet as friends. Killian is a gorgeous man with a penchant for cruelty and he doesn’t hold back at their first meeting. The two of them attend rival colleges which are both located on Brighton Island off the coast of England.

I have said it before and I will say it again, but I absolutely love books about psychopath’s and sociopath’s that fall in love. I love it when someone who doesn’t feel emotions in the traditional way finally falls for one special person. Rina Kent does it so well. She is the reigning queen of the dark romance and I just love her anti-hero’s. This book is told in multiple points of view, mainly in Glyndon’s, but there are plenty of chapters in Killian’s point of view as well. I love seeing into the mind of the anti-hero, so we can really get an idea of what they are thinking. We can see the obsession first hand. It is fun to watch as the hardened emotionless guy struggles to figure out why he is so interested in a particular female.There are so many interesting characters in this book. Luckily Rina put some family & relationship trees at the start of the book, which I found myself looking back on more than once as we met new characters. I loved the bonds between the sisters, brothers, cousins and friends. Especially given that there are so many sociopaths, psychopaths and mafia monsters in the mix. It certainly made things interesting and makes me what to read all the rest of this series right away. I won’t go into the triggers and all the bad things that Killian does, but to say that there are many. Because if you don’t like reading about this kind of guy, then you shouldn’t be reading Rina Kent books. She writes for those of us that like dark romance, bullies, and anti-hero’s and she makes no bones about it. I for one love them and I haven’t disliked a book of hers that I have read so far. I voluntarily read & reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts & opinions are my own.Blog|Goodreads|Facebook|Instagram|Twitter|BookBub",5

You don't have to include it in *every* book to make your heroes ""edgey.""I've been burned by this author before, but I've all I've seen is how different this book is, how dark it is, and how the hero is like no other. But really? Where was all of it? The only thing that was dark was that brutal rape scene, but it's OK because our heroine-- lovingly duped as a warm glory hole -- wanted it all along. Bitch where?!?! And you cannot convince me that this dude is hunky, interesting, or appealing on any level. He openly admits to wanting to rip things-- both animals and people -- apart and see what they look like underneath the skin. He's that skinny guy with long greasy hair that's always straightening his bangs in the back of the classroom, and thinks the dumpster behind the cafeteria is the best make out spot. We all have one guy in high school that fits this.🤷‍♀️ also he needs to rape women to feel like a big strong man. This dude belongs in a straight jacket, not a romance novel.Also, was there a plot? The same conversation was repeated over and over again. And the one couple I'm halfway excited about will probably be ruined or just won't happen at all. And PSA: the only way a rape fantasy can truly work is if: the couple trusts one another explicitly, AND there's a safeword if things go too far. So girl, having a deranged hero force his cock in a virgin cunt to make it bleed is not it boo. Just call me a 🤡 for being fooled by this author once more.",1
"571","208415817","|| 1.0 star || Um…What.The.Fuck.!??!?????I��m absolutely flabbergasted that anyone could call this a romance book. It’s a horror story, from start to finish. I honestly don’t even want to believe that this book actually exists in this genre.The hero literally rapes the heroine when they first meet and then he continues to rape her for almost the whole book until she finally gives into him completely and becomes his permanent fuck-toy without fighting back anymore. The heroine has a lot of self-esteem issues and doesn’t have the energy to fight against this monster in the end, so she just gives up. He tells her what to do at all times, and eventually she just does it without even bothering to say no or voice her opinion, because she knows she has no say anyway. He continues to slap, choke and rape her, but somehow that’s okay, because now she sort of wants it…?How can this sound like a happy ending to anyone!??This story is a goddamn tragedy, and it’s making me loose all faith in humanity that some people are actually SIMPING for this abusive rapist while calling the victim “boring”. There’s just no way.WHAT.THE.FUCK.

' 🅶🅾🅳 🅾🅵 🅼🅰🅻🅸🅲🅴 ' Is the first full length book in author Rina Kent's 'Legacy of Gods' series. Spoken in multiple POV's. What a  CrAzY  ride! Twists and turns, rival college gangs, initiation like the hunger games into a secret society run by a group of psychopaths. But they have nothing on ‘Killer’ the boy who set his sights on the girl he should’ve left well enough alone. A threatening presence in her life, she wanted answers to a death which plagued her and she was certain he was at the bottom of it. He wanted to dominate her. These two combusted my iPad, hotter than the desert. “𝕴 𝖘𝖕𝖊𝖓𝖙 𝖒𝖞 𝖜𝖍𝖔𝖑𝖊 𝖑𝖎𝖋𝖊 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖊𝖘𝖘𝖎𝖓𝖌 𝖒𝖞 𝖙𝖗𝖚𝖊 𝖓𝖆𝖙𝖚𝖗𝖊, 𝖇𝖚𝖙 𝕴’𝖉 𝖜𝖎𝖑𝖑𝖎𝖓𝖌𝖑𝖞 𝖊𝖒𝖇𝖗𝖆𝖈𝖊 𝖒𝖞 𝖉𝖊𝖒𝖔𝖓𝖘 𝖋𝖔𝖗 𝖞𝖔𝖚.”Glyndon King is an art student, a sketcher and dabbler in contemporary impressionism attending the Royal Elite University.

"579","57426932","This is the worst book I've ever read. I know I keep making little edits to this review here and there but it's just because it's been more than two years since I read this and I still think about how bad it is at least once a week. If I could unread one book in my life, it would be Gothikana. Video review on my TikTok here.The concept of Gothikana is almost interesting and maybe had some potential to be a good Gothic Romance, but the execution just isn't there. 2 Stars.  Edit: after taking a couple days to think about this, I'm dropping it to a 1.5. This book is terrible.  Edit January 2023: I'm just seeing this review again and I can't believe I ever gave it 1.5 stars, much less 2. Maybe I was trying to be nice? I'm much more confident in the way I rate and review now and this book, for me, is the reason 1 star reviews exist. 15 months later I still think about how bad this book was all the time.There are three areas where this book seriously falls apart: the writing style, the complete lack of editing, and the actual story.Writing Style:The writing is heinous. It is nearly impossible to believe an actual grown adult wrote any of this. It reads like a bad fanfiction written by a thirteen year old, and I'm not just going to say that and move on, I'm including a passage from the book below. I found myself reading slower because I was actively re-writing lines in my head to make it flow more seamlessly, fix improper word usage, and generally just sound better. This passage is a pretty good indicator of the style throughout the book:
  ""Dr. Kari was one of her scariest professors in the semester. He had down tilted dark eyes and a fierce white beard, and he was strict. One time a girl got late to the class and he made her stand outside in the corridor in full view until she had gone red in the face from humiliation. Students were scared to ask him a question. But it didn't end there. He also seemed to enjoy looking at young girls too much in the class, all eighteen-year-old first-years except an older Corvina.""
A couple more:
  ""Corvina felt sick not just with the night but with the story, thinking about a man in a situation she was as a woman forced him. It was absolutely disgusting.
No, you don't have a concussion. You're not reading that wrong and I didn't type it wrong. Look at the video I linked above where I include a picture of this passage in the book to prove this is actually how it was written.
  ""Corvina leaned against the wall for support, a glass of drink in her hand...
Mmm, my favorite, a glass of drink.I could go on for pages and pages about how bad the writing is, but I think you get it.Editing (or lack thereof):2024 Edit: This book was picked up by Tor's new imprint Bramble for traditional publication and released a couple months ago. To this end, from quickly flipping through the Bramble edition in the bookstore it appears that the book mostly got a quick pass for copy editing, rendering this specfic section on editing potentially moot for the current version. The writing style and story appear to have remained largely the same save for the most egregious technical mistakes. For example, the first block of text I included above is nearly identical, having only changed one word and one comma if I recall correctly. The following note on the complete lack of editing pertains to the book as it was published and as I purchased and read it in 2021. Color me shocked on it garnering a trad pub book deal. This book wasn't edited or proofread at all. The author clearly didn't even bother to run spell check, which is where I admittedly start to lose my patience with a book. It's annoying, as a reader, to think about the fact that I paid X amount of dollars for a book the author couldn't be arsed to comb for spelling errors. I completely understand that things get missed, but it's excessive in Gothikana. Chapter breaks occasionally have special art pages with famous quotes, and you'd think a copy and paste quote would be safe from spelling errors...but you'd be wrong. Gothikana is chock-full of misspelled words, incorrect word usage (i.e. ""compatible"" where she meant ""companionable,"" among a multitude of other instances), constant misuse of punctuation, run-on sentences and sentence fragments abound, and missing movement in the writing (a character moving from one place to another in a scene seemingly by teleporting since the writing never indicated movement, which actually creates a big problem in the climactic scene of the book). If you get twitchy at unedited books, this will be completely unreadable.((Edit: In talking with someone who's reading the ebook, it sounds like the digital version may have been edited/updated. The paperbacks being sold have definitely not received the same treatment.))The Story:As for the story itself, I understand that this is much more subjective but it didn't work for me either. Even beyond the technical aspects of the writing, there's just a lot that doesn't make sense in the story. From the fact that it's a university full of adults who are told they can't leave or use the one single phone on campus without express permission from faculty (if someone tried to tell me I couldn't use a phone to call my doctor when I was twenty one years old I would have punched them in the face, but our main character and every student on campus seem to think that's completely reasonable) to a psychiatrist telling a girl with a history of schizophrenia from BOTH parents that the voices she hears in her head aren't a problem...I spent a lot of the book sayingNone of that even covers the massive amount of plot holes and narrative threads that are started and then abandoned with no resolution. It's like the author started with an attempt at a cohesive plot and just gave up entirely about halfway through, then made it to the end and realized they didn't have answers for any of the questions they themselves created, and tried to make it seem like the total lack of an ending was intentional. The book legitimately goes from the climactic scene straight to an epilogue with a time jump. You want answers to questions posed by the beginning of the story? Too bad, you're not getting any.Overall I found pacing to be poor, the romance was extremely underdeveloped, and while the plot maybe had some interesting potential at its foundation, it all just completely falls apart. It reads like the author didn't know how to finish the book so there's no resolution for anything and it gets a meta ending that was never earned. Props for at least starting with a plot that I wanted to be invested in, but literally none of it was done well.I would have DNFd this book very early on if I didn't have a self-imposed policy about finishing a book once I start it.",1

(meanwhile, what I actually look like while being frustratingly mad or madly frustrated:)All due to the wasted potential of this book.First and foremost, I absolutely loved 📍enticingly mysterious cover;📍enticingly mysterious title;📍enticingly mysterious atmosphere of a dark academy that takes residence in an enticingly mysterious castle, surrounded by e̶n̶t̶i̶c̶i̶n̶g̶l̶y̶ ̶m̶y̶s̶t̶e̶r̶i̶o̶s̶ vast forest and tainted with deadly secrets and enigmatic suicides. Well, by the looks of it, today I've been banned from Thesaurus.com: Synonyms and Antonyms of Words. Might as well go with the flow and end my misery by writing a very short review, since I'm not enjoying reliving this reading experience in the least. CORVINA, the heroine of this story, also answers to little crow:The large path of the evolution of the human brain from early primates to great apes and ultimately to Homo sapiens, a few million years path, mind you, just so that Corvina uses it only as a device for thinking non-stop about Vad's cock?? Truly sad. I don't want to complain about the insta-lust on both parts, but it eventually gets on a reader's nerves when they are forced to read about fictional people's genitalia and wonderous ways in which reproductive organs affect their intelectual capabilities. Instant attraction, obviously, provides a solid ground for deep connection and relationship. Nevertheless, when the whole relationship development amounts to heated glances and stolen kisses? It gets annoying, as anything repetitive ultimately does. VAD, the hero of the story, also answers to devil.For someone who is supposed to be smart (he's a professor, after all, and a protagonist whom readers are expected to root for) that guy demonstrated the unprecedented lack of common sense. He wouldn't recognize discretion if it slapped him right in his dumb face.Any kind of personal relationship between teachers and students is prohibited according to the academy's rules. To top it off, anyone who got entangled with Vad in the past (his female students, for one 😏), one way or another came to no good.So, naturally, the most logical thing for him would be to stare at his new female victim (oops did I just say victim instead of student 👁️👁️) in the class/in the halls/ (insert any public space of the said academy) as if she were an oasis in his personal desert. 🤡 Let the whole world wait and see while he fantasises about his student during his working hours:D1001 high-class techniques for making any hero seem protective vs readers invested in the couple's forbidden relationship.Vad was the type of hero I would normally fancy: jealous, possessive... silver-eyed, too. 🤤 Yet, he low-scored on an IQ-test. I'll PASS, send me the next one. 🚬OVERALLI thought that there were a couple of scenes that managed to create incredibly atmospheric setting to the story. But juvenile dialogues, as well as unwarranted obscene language (frequent fucks, shits) took away from the gothic elegance this book had a potential to deliver. In my humble opinion, the author should have made her writing style classier, with lexicon that lacks in elements that we, basic bitches, are awash with on a daily basis.I quickly got equally bored with both: the suspense and the romantic development that actually lacked any 'development'. I reached the ~60% mark and started skimming. Suffice it to say, I got bored with skimming too. 😂In case anyone wants to inform me of how the whole mystery was resolved at the end, it would be highly appreciated. (why does this sentence sound so formal to me, though?? 😭)

"584","57426932","DNFed halfway through I don’t usually rate/review books I don’t finish but this is genuinely the worst book I’ve ever read - which I don’t say lightly. Usually I’ll never say outright “don’t read this book” but my god. I have never been so baffled as to how this has so many high ratings. This book is clearly just here for the aesthetics, an angsty romance on a “dark academia” backdrop - or an attempt at one. The first few pages initially impressed me for its pretty gothic designs, a playlist, map, the full shebang. But lo and behold, it seems more energy was put into the design of the book that it’s contents, for it was riddled with errors and clearly needed an editor. Being self published I could let the occasional typo slide, but when the fourth one I came across was a misspelling of the word “happy” on a page with a whole seven words in total on it, in a huge graphic design quote…that just made me think the author hadn’t even bothered to read it through either. So why should I?Not only that, but the dark academia aesthetic it was apparently striving for was nowhere to be seen beyond needing a reason for all these characters to be in one building. The dialogue made me cringe so hard I physically recoiled, and what I assume was meant to be a steamy sex scene just read like a violation. So yeah, a DNF from me.",1

This is clearly a case of it's me, not the book.I've been wanting to read more romantasy lately, so I picked up Gothikana on a whim without looking at it too carefully, drawn in by its Beauty and the Beast vibes. And it turned out to be a dark gothic romance with some hints of the paranormal. While there's nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't what I was hoping for.Right off the bat, this feels steeped in atmosphere. All the descriptions of turrets, gargoyles, flickering candles, and moonlit woods infused the story with a creepiness and gothic darkness that was hard to look away from. It felt like Beast's castle brought to life, just without the dancing accoutrements. Add to that the ghostly echoes and the school setting, and you have dark academia in spades.But as the story went on, it became clear that this was first and foremost a romance, and a fairly dramatic one at that. It suffers from so much insta-love and lust that I found it hard to take the coupling seriously. One moment they were giving each smoldering eyes, the next minute they were doing the deed everywhere, with so much overwrought explicitness I was cringing on the inside. It's never good when I'm embarrassed for the couple, and that's what happened here.The part I was looking forward to the most was the fantasy element, and it just never quite materialized to my satisfaction. I wanted primarily a fantasy with some romance to spice it up, and what I got instead was a romance with no real fantasy and a sprinkling of the paranormal. Without that fantasy element, I never quite connected with the story despite it being entertaining enough.Also, one other thing. Everywhere I look, everyone's agog over dark academia, but—and please don't throw rotten eggs at me for saying this—I just don't get the appeal. Just like how I wouldn't get excited about stories set in dark grocery stores, dark restaurants, or dark workplaces, I'm unable to muster up too much excitement for dark academia. Maybe it's because I only know of studious academia (the setting where I went to school), or maybe I just haven't read a good one yet. Either way, I'm pretty indifferent, and this book didn't change my mind.Since it's a clearly case of mismatched expectations, I can't really fault the book. I suspect many readers would enjoy the very things I take issues with, so don't let me dissuade you if this sounds like your thing. And if you're a fan of gothic romances and dark academia (whatever that is), definitely don't pass this up.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3
"588","57426932","Ugh I am so mad rn because I wanted answers and I need them. A LOT OF THEM. If you want to read this book and expect to get answer about what happened then do not read this because you do not get them. I was so excited about this. The plot seemed great and the description of the castle was really nice and I wanted to get fully immersed in the story. The mystery also started off great and I was excited to read about it but we never get any answers which just made me extremely mad. It fell flat because of that especially because sooooo many things happen. We have the mystery of Corvina and why she is the way she is, the Thesis of Vad, the purple eyes, the ball, the disappearing of students, the witches, the rituals, the lake, the forest, the powder and nothing gets answered or just very broadly explained by saying it is because the mountain is magical. It made me hate the second part of this story especially when the characters full out said that some things don't have or need answers. Uh yes I do need answers that is why I am reading this???",1
"589","57426932","Gothikana was one of my most anticipated reads of this year, and now, it's become one of my favorites! RuNyx did not disappoint in any capacity! Corvina Clemm and Vad Deverell are unlike any couple I've read before, and I loved every minute of their story!  Corvina grew up in an unconventional manner raised and homeschooled by her schizophrenic mother that doesn't like people or to speak more than necessary. Throughout her childhood, she had only the crows, her books, and the voice in her head to keep her company. When an invitation to attend Verenmore arrives, it comes as a surprise... one she never expected would change her life.  ""𝑰𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒂𝒅𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔,"" 𝒔𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒂𝒍𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝒂𝒈𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕 𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒑𝒔, ""𝒅𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒏 𝒎𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝒊𝒕.""  Suspense, steam, murder, mystery, forbidden love, a heroine with questionable mental stability, and a hero with questionable morals, it's like this book was written just for me! Everything from the atmosphere to the orgasms is utter perfection! It has a dark, eerie vibe that I couldn't get enough of, and Vad and Corvina are some of the most intriguing and unique characters I've ever read.  Verenmore, a character in it's own right, is the exclusive university where Corvina attends and Vad teaches. It sits atop a secluded mountain, beautiful and terrifying with ghosts of the past haunting the halls and the woods on the castle grounds. This majestic setting and the secrets it holds made the story so much fun and created an ambience both romantic and downright creepy.  Everything in this book is mysterious. It's written in such a way that you're constantly uncertain and completely captivated. The history of Verenmore, the voices, the shadows, the suicides, the supposed curse, the woods, the lake, a century of murders and disappearances, and even the main characters themselves keep you guessing the whole way through!  This is the part of my review where I would normally start gushing over the characters and discussing the plot. However, I realized that everything else I have to say could possibly spoil something or take away from the overall experience of the story. Believe me, you don't want that! You owe it to yourself to experience this book in the way it was intended, and Vad and Corvina deserve no less!  Spine-tingling, atmospheric, sexy, and macabre, Gothikana is gothic romance and dark academia in its finest form. It's a spooky smorgasbord of preternatural activity with surprises around every corner, and I sincerely hope Runyx gives us more of this world. Either way, she just got a brand new fan!",5

Like i get that smut is a genre in itself and while that's not what im into and did not go into this book expecting to see, i have to believe that i have an issue with this book not solely because it isn’t “my thing” but because this has to be an atrociously bad example of it… right? RIGHT????? Everything and i mean everything in this book is at its best awkward/corny or at its worst downright creepy. plotwise it was clear that anything that didn’t directly have to do with the romance was a heavy afterthought. at points it genuinely felt like satire it was getting so ridiculous, then decided to get META at the end to explain away the plot holes? META????????????????????????? consider me retired from booktok recommendations jesus christon a brighter note those ppl saying kindles make u read faster were NOT joking...",1
"592","57426932","you couldn’t pay me to believe this wasn’t wednesday addams x harry potter fan fictioni already don’t like teacher x student, which i didn’t know this was but that’s my fault for not reading the description. no matter how much the author wanted to age up the main character i feel like it doesn’t work because this college has the feeling of a high school. mainly because it’s literally hogwarts but whatever. i thought the main character was boring despite reminding me of wednesday addams (who i love) i found the teacher creepy from the start, he literally was a predator considering he was the one who found her and invited her to the school.the tarot was underused and it definitely is but what annoyed me was that the character never interprets the cards. she’d pull a card like ‘two or cups’ but that’s all, it doesn’t help the story for people who don’t do tarot. also even tho i do tarot and i know what it means every reader has a different interpretation. a weird thing i noticed is that Vad’s name was barely used like there’d be scenes between them and it’d just describe him and then would be like “he” instead of Vad and i’d be like who???i reread this book for a video and the first time i read it i didn’t notice how much this author beats things over your head like the amount of times the words: little crow, devil, witch and madness was sooo fucking annoying. another thing is that this book isn’t fantasy, it tries to make it seem like witchcraft is real but honestly doesn’t flesh it out enough. this book tries so hard to be dark but it just isn’t, vad and corvina are the equivalent to those weird couples that date in high school. the grammatical errors and such were definitely fixed in this book so i do appreciate that but there was some things about the book that could’ve been fixed like the repetition. there are parts of this book that just feels lazy, there are plots that are dropped or there’s absolutely no explanation for them. they’re acknowledged but still no explanation and the author just goes “some things don’t have answers” girl that’s just laziness you are not a good enough writer to pull that off.",2

At 53% nothing has happened but this emo FMC walking around a cemetery and hearing voices in her head, seeing some so called spooky things and her having insta lust for her professor.

I didn’t really care much about the romance, I was more interested in the eerie atmosphere and the creepy gothic elements in it. I definitely preferred the author’s dark verse series more, but this was still good enough. The plot and the setting were fine, I just wasn’t a fan of the characters or the romance.
  ”You’re the mountain I build my castle on, brick by brick,”
I wish the romance wasn’t so insta. I would’ve loved to see their development, but they just happened so fast. I’d take Tristan’s silent treatment than this. I think they slept together once, he ignored her for weeks, and then he was going all alpha and claiming her. I was like dude chill you’re moving so fast. It was kinda too much and not really convincing. Or maybe it’s the fact that I’m a sucker for a good slow burn which would’ve really worked with this book.",3

"599","57426932","Just some thoughts and things I didn't like about the book, but it was sadly such a disappointment. A few spoilers1. 3rd person POV- not a fan usually. But this particular writing here made it hard to connect with the characters, and the way the author uses ""she"" and ""he"" so often, and not the name of the person, it made it super confusing if the sentence was about another character or the MC.2. insta love 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩3. Personally, I like the age gap to be a bit bigger in teacher/student books for the more taboo aspect, so this was kind of like... Yeah...so what?4. Cliche5. Boring6. Calling the hero ""devil"" is so cringe omg 7. ""This madness""8. The hero already has fcked at least one student and I think another professor, so what's so special about the heroine? Her eye color? Give me a break. 9. Where is the discreetness? 10. If the heroine gets horny one more time... I swear🙄 11. Wouldn't it be nice to not have to wear a bra everyday 😒12. ""Our madness""13. Where is the 🔥🔥? Their relationship was dry AF 14. The dialogue is super immature 15. For how much she was warned to stay away from him and how much he pushed her away, she started to look a little pathetic giving in to him so easily 16. The author is trying way too hard to make the hero mysterious and all, that it made me lose even more interest in him with how forced it is17. Omg if I hear them talking about their ""madness"" one more time...🤡18. All the mentions of hero's past relationships and experiences. Such as one of him sharing his friend's gf 🙃19. Heroine getting hot and bothered finding out about that 🤮10. Apparently it's not a dark acedemia book without some orgies21. Dark & suspense= orgy22. Random school orgy that was so out of the blue and made me dislike this book even more tbh (hero and heroine did not join in with others, but it was pretty much a room full of the students having sex with each other, heroine and hero we're doing some stuff too and getting off on it)23. School orgies I guess is the answer to bring everyone closer on a night where everyone is on high alert for someone to go missing or die24. Hear enough about the orgy yet? 25. THAT'S IT?🙄🙄🙄 26. Wow, the only time I've actually liked the hero is in the last 5 pages. Shocking.27. The end. Things I did like:1. The atmosphere 2. The mental illness aspect3. The coverSafety:Virgin heroine/ imma say hero is a ho since he's fcked 3 people that I know of so far, that go/went to the school or worked there, and he has a vasectomy (random detail I know, but I thought it was pretty random in the book too)Ow drama- not really drama but we get a lot of talk about his past relationships and experiencesSharing- not with h, but he did previously share his friend's gf, and hero is a bit of an exhibitionist No cheating Om drama- none but some jealousy because of her male friend Not sure if I'm missing anything 🤔",2

This is complete nonsense. Firstly, writing isn’t a competitive sport. Secondly, I only publish reviews of books in the subgenre where I’m best known (queer romcom) if I have good things to say. And finally: taking time out of my life to read an entire book, then write a detailed review about it that some people on GR will look at would be a profoundly inefficient and ineffective way to damage the careers of other authors. If you can’t credit me with simply being a person who loves books and likes talking about them, at least credit me with enough common sense to be a better villain. *******************************************I don’t quite know how to talk about this book. I picked it up because I thought it was going to be … you know the sort of bananas I enjoy. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the sort of bananas I don’t enjoy. It is, however, clearly the sort of bananas other people enjoy. And I hope we can, you know, co-exist with our independent banana preferences. It’s just … I don’t know. I kind of felt a little bit like I was reading My Immortal? I mean the heroine has purple eyes and is called Corvina and is described like this:A short, slight girl of questionable heritage, with slanted violet eyes, sun-kissed skin even though she rarely spent much time in the sun anymore, a nose ring, long, black hair in a fishtail braid that reached her waist, dressed in loose black pants and a thin purple sweater.Please note, however, that these black trousers are a gross assault on Corina’s identity because:wearing one of her black full-sleeved tops and brown maxi skirts, a black ribbon choker around her neck, brown lipstick on her mouth, black liner outlining her odd violet eyes, hair in a fishtail braid, silver danglers hanging from her ears, silver ring piercing her nose, and the multi-crystal bracelet on her left wrist she never took off except to recharge, Corvina felt most like herself.I swear to God, I have never read the words maxi skirt or fishtail braid more in my entire life than I did over the course of this single book. (I am too fucking old for what Gothikana is trying to serve me– what the hell even is a maxi skirt and/or a fishtail braid. *Googles* Okay so a long skirt and a French plait but, like, EDGY).This is also something we learn about Corvina in the opening six percent of this book:“Bras and Corvina were not friends. Having grown up the way she had, all alone with just her mother for company, bras had seemed necessary only in a while. Panties she wore every day except when she just didn’t want to.”TMI, FICTIONAL GIRL. Why am I—the reader—being told this? And in this bizarrely toneless style that sounds like the book is being narrated by the Google Maps voice. I mean, we find out Corvina doesn’t like underwear later via the hero sticking a finger in her so if nothing else, this is completely redundant information. But it also feels genuinely weird for one of the first things we learn about the character we are spending the next however many pages with is that her bits are flying free and living wild. It’s sort of the textual equivalent of someone coming to you at non-sexual social event and being like “Hello, my name is Corvina, I’m a libra vegetarian, and I am pantsless right the fuck now.” Let me get to know you a bit before you tell me about the below stairs coverage or lack thereof. Anyway, Corvina here is home schooled in the middle of nowhere by a mother with paranoid schizophrenia who talks to crows. After her mother is institutionalised, she receives a mysterious invitation to a mysterious university that invites students from under-privileged backgrounds to access higher education. Which is excellent. Except, as we quickly find out upon Corvina’s arrival, the mysterious university of mysteriousness is … like … this dark and haunted castle where the students keep dying. Never a good sign. Also not a good sign is the presence among the teaching staff of a PhD student called Vad Deverell, who is this sharp tongued, silver-eyed crush bait with a dark reputation. It is later explained why this guy is somehow being allowed to do teaching (I mean apart from the spurious “they couldn’t get anyone else” offered at the beginning) and it makes a mite more sense than it initially seems. A mite. Not more than a mite. Needless to say, Vad and Corvina get it on after some smouldering and library-inspired fingering, the mysteries of Weird Castle University are mostly unravelled, and that’s … that’s the book, really.In bare bones, I think this is probably fairly engaging? And it’s willing to go some pretty dark places—it’s just I’m sure how equipped it is to handle those places, having gone there. For example, there’s a sort of on-going thread regarding Covina’s mother’s mental health, and whether Covina herself is suffering from the same illness or legitimately supernaturally attuned. And where that takes us ultimately is here:“But [Corvina’s mother] not only raised Corvina all on her own, she was rational enough to make a living, homeschool her, teach her everything she needed to be selfsufficient, all the while dealing with her own undiagnosed condition. It is one of the most extraordinary things I’ve heard. But then, maternal instinct has always been something understudied.”I’m kind of—having complicated feelings about this? Because on the one hand, that’s great. After all, the idea that someone with a mental health condition can’t take care of others or function in the world is super toxic. Except this also seems to be implying that if a woman is sufficiently *maternal* she can overcome, you know, paranoid schizophrenia. Which in turn implies that anyone who does need extra support to parent—or indeed just couldn’t parent— for mental health reasons just didn’t mother hard enough. Anyway, the other major arc of the book is Corvina’s relationship with Vad. And this is … I mean. It almost makes 50 Shades of Grey look healthy. I mean, say what you will about Ana and Christian AT LEAST HE WASN’T HER ACTUAL TEACHER. And yes, yes, I know teacher/student is a thing for some people and probably fits the dark academia theme (more on dark academia in a bit, btw) but, like, even in—especially in—dark academia uncomfortable teacher-student dynamics are supposed to be a bad thing. Not an HEA. This is like if The Secret History ended with Henry and Julian Morrow getting together. In any case, all you need to know about Vad is that when Corvina tells him she’s a virgin he responds:“You chose the wrong guy for your first time, little crow”Wow. Hot. I feel I’m being more negative about this book than I would like to be about, well, any book, really. I can genuinely appreciate the *exuberance* in Gothikana, you can’t go wrong with a murder university plot, and there’s some solid writing here, for sure. But it also, ultimately, felt quite juvenile to me, probably because I am old enough to find nose rings fairly banal and, in a professional capacity, more inclined to obsess over Vad Deverell’s terrible teaching than his sexy silver eyes. I think what also lowkey bugs me—not that I think this is any reflection on the author—is that Simon & Schuster bought this thing on the basis of its TikTok success (which is immense, btw, so don’t come for me: just because a book doesn't work for me doesn’t mean I can’t celebrate the accomplishment of the author) and couldn’t even show it enough respect to excise a few of the repetitions and tighten the prose. Let it shine a bit. Because, honestly, it could. It really could.The other thing Gothikana kind of got me thinking about was the whole … what is dark academia for/about chestnut. I know dark academia is supposedly big right now, and I think there’s always been a kind of hopeful push towards making academic happen somewhere other than Tumblr but I think part of what makes that really difficult, borderline impossible, is translating it from an aesthetic or a vibe to an actual book that is a) functional as a story b) feels true to the themes/preoccupations of whatever dark academia supposed to be about. The thing is, The Secret History—which probably originated the whole shebang—did this so successfully and so comprehensively that it’s hard to know where to go from there. I’m not saying it’s impossible, I think Atlas manages by bringing magic to the table, and I think Babel and Catherine House do the same by bringing, um, colonialism. But I think Gothikana where you end up when dark academia is almost entirely aesthetic. And while that’s fine—if that’s what draws you to dark academia, more power to you—it’s part of what contributed to the book feeling slightly shallow and unconvincing to me personally. Like, apparently the hero’s thesis topic is “correlation and influence of music on literature through the ages”. And, I mean, Jesus wept, no wonder he hasn’t finished the thing: the sheer impossible breadth of that would get you laughed out of the room in any academic institution that was not an isolated murder castle. And obviously--*obviously*--it is not reasonable to expect any book with dark academia theming to be The Secret History or to even *want* to be The Secret History. Gothikana clearly has its own interests, and they’re maxi skirts and men who are eye-wateringly inept at dirty talk. It’s just when you’ve grown up with:Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.it’s a bit weird to find yourself at:Girls I interact with dance with death much sooner than they shouldI’m absolutely not saying the latter doesn’t have a place, and clearly it has an appeal to a lot of readers. It’s just that, for me, while I’m definitely up for having fun with dark academia … this isn’t my kind of fun.It may well be your kind of fun. And no shade if it is.",NA

"602","57426932","Ever since I was a kid and the first time I finally got my hands on Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, books such as Gothikana have been one of my very favorite things. And with the legends and old wives tales abounding this is giving me everything I could possibly want.Fantastic world building. The sexual tension is phenomenal. Interesting that he keeps warning her away from him but he’s continually the one seeking her out, trying to get her attention. Perhaps you should listen to your own warnings, Mr Deverell. Holy shit! That scene in the library made my heart palpitate, made it hard to breath. Goddam, he is one sexy mofo! Corvina is fearless, almost borderline sociopathic by her lack of emotions that only appear to be brought out by the silver eyed devil. It makes for a new, interesting take on an h and I couldn’t be happier by that. “If this is madness,” she whispered almost against his lips, “drown me in it.” “If this is madness,” he told her, echoing her words against her lips, “I’ve already descended too far.” -DEAD! 🥵🔥Oh yay, she called him out on his bs. “You give me mixed signals, you know?” she told him quietly. “When you say stuff like that, it’s one. Then you warn me away from you, it’s another. You need to make up your mind about what you want from me.”Is she crazy or is it real? And if it’s real what is it? That’s the age old question. One that’s common since the beginning of gothic romance. God, he already reminded me of Emeric from Dark Notes and than he put her on the piano. 👀In the end I had an inkling but not the whole story for what came to pass. While the mystery was good it paled in comparison to the love they share. But really that’s the most important part. He’ll always be her Devil, her madness, her mountain. She’ll always be his witch, his little crow, his castle. In this life and hopefully every one that comes after.",5

I agree with what another reviewer said that the only feeling this book gave me was indifference.A few thoughts: I tried to read The Predator before and couldn't because the writing was bad. This wasn't the case in this one. I thought the writing was much better and it flowed nicely, even though some sentences were still stilted and a bit juvenile. Kudos for the improvement though!My issues were with the story and characters. I just didn't care about any of them. Corvina was a little bland and I couldn't warm up to Vad at all. Their dialogue was interesting in parts, but I wasn't invested enough. Safety for what I did read (I skimmed a lot too)  heroine is a virgin because she's been isolated her entire life. The hero came across as a manwhore and I did not care about that at all. It's one of the reasons why I didn't warm up to him.

"604","57426932","2.5⭐️This started out okay, but around the halfway point I just started to lose interest. However I did have pretty low expectations going into this so I wasn’t too surprised by just overall feeling underwhelmedThe romance: it felt very insta lovie to me so it really lacked that tension and angst you typically get from a professor/student relationship. I just didn’t really feel the chemistry between the couple so I was a bit disconnected from them. The spice was SCRUMPTIOUS at first but towards the end I just started to skip over it because I felt like that’s what they’re relationship revolves around. I loved our MMC in the beginning but he ended up just lacking any sort of depth for me, I think I just wanted so much more from him. I liked the FMC but felt like she also just bored me a bit.The plot: I did really enjoy the murder mystery aspect of this but I honestly can’t pinpoint exactly what it was, but something was just MISSING! I wasn’t at all invested in what happened and I think that’s because the romance took the front seat. What to expect- dark gothic romance- Professor/student- Murder mystery- Dark academia - Spooky vibes - Morally grey MMC Overall, it was fine but I don’t think I would recommend it at the end of the day.",2
"605","57426932","3.5★See, the thing with this book is that I set my expectations way too high. Don´t get me wrong I liked it, but there were just way too many things left unanswered. It's actually frustrating the hell out of me tbh cus now I have to fill the voids of unanswered things myself. Like common you write a whole 450 pages book and you couldn't make it a bit longer to give us readers some answers? In case someone finds the answers, it would be highly appreciated if you let me know.

Our silver eyed professor, he was sexy in the relationship but umm how can you always only fall for your students? No judging, just curious.🫣 It´s okay for one time but every fucking time is....I kinda found him too lust driven in the second half but I actually also loved how he cared about her there. Ehh struggle cuz I have 2 kinds of thoughts about him. One where I liked him and one where I disliked him. It really dependent on how he acted. Anyway I liked his nickname for Corvina. Overall I liked the story but it's not the best thing I've ever read. I did enjoy the ending even though it´s left unanswered, it made me so excited and curious while reading it.

They don't know each other, they dont really talk to each other, they just fuck a lot and drop in little details in between when they have had time to catch their breath.Corvina (ugh, that name) and Vad (ugh, that name) just start eye fucking each other from day one and from then on it's straight on to love and marriage talk. The only thing Vad (ugh, that name) has going for him is his looks because his personality got lost in the mail somewhere. Yes, he's tall, dark and brooding and I'll admit he ticks all the boxes but aside from that we don't really get to know much about him until well into the second half of the book. And even then it's just not that interesting. When he took her virginity very roughly I stopped caring about him in general and knew there was nothing left for me to enjoy about this man. I knew I was right when I later on found out his girth and size could be compared to an adult's arm. Add that on top of the numerous ""Really???"" moments that made me frown. Before coming to the castle Corvina (ugh, that name) is home schooled by a schizophrenic recluse (her mother) and so well adjusted she makes me look like a psycho. Hell, she makes your sweet grandmother seem like one. Sure, she hears voices, but nobody knows and aside from that she seems like just a normal girl with a weird fashion sense and shudders violet eyes. (again, really?????)The plot was somewhat interesting but the constant cheesy dialogue between Corvina (ugh, that name) and Vad (ugh, that name) was just nauseating and stopped me from enjoying anything that was happening all together.",1
"607","57426932","This was such a spooky and atmospheric romance unlike anything I've read before! I loved that this took place at a spooky college that had all of the creepy elements. We had creepy woods, a creepy lake, a creepy cemetery, and a creepy old school with secret tunnels and strange murders. Vad is a professor with a bad boy reputation and Corvina is immediately intrigued by him. They enter a relationship, but Corvina doesn't know how much she can trust Vad or what rumors about him are true. While it was a professor/student romance, nothing felt too taboo because Corvina was only about five years younger that Vad. It was definitely creepy following the two of them as they were trying to uncover more about the mysterious deaths that have happened at the college and in the town. I also liked how suspenseful things became at the end and the secrets that came out. If you're in the mood for an atmospheric dark academia romance, you should definitely check this out. We were left with a lot of unanswered questions, so I'm hoping the author writes a second book after this!",4
"608","200124498","Thanks emily for the sort of arc (more explaination bellow)thanks employee at pinguin for fucking up and sending the book 10 days before release to my bookstore so that i could still read it <3 you a real one  I honestly think this is my most liked book by emily. was it her best one? probably not. there's no plot, mostly smut, and a lot of depth to the 3 main characters. Pucking around and pucking wild both had a lot of ""plot"" so to speak, but because pucking sweet follows the same time line you wouldn't want to repeat a lot of scenes. the thing is that because of that the plot lacked A LOTso if you want to read about characters and their problems and their development, you would love this. are you looking for a plot similar to PA and PW, you should try it still but it might not be your cup of tea.anyway, LUKAS!!!! my baby boy, i related a bit  too  much to him. loved feeling personally attacked by his story arc.best boi frand colton, i loved him so much. and him and lukas kgjdkfjgdk idk they just fit. even tho i personally would have loved a bit more focus on them.and poppy. our strong female lead. i loved her! probably one of my favourite leads emily has written. she is strong, she knows what she wants and she goes for it.the story arcs were so well done.should it be the almost 600 pages this book is? probably not. did i enjoy it nontheless? for sure.if you liked the two previous books in the series, i would for sure recommend reading this one.4.75/5///////////// this next segment i would call ""bro wtf this whole situation is fishy and idk what to do with it but just to inform you i will tell you about it"" no hate towards the author, but just a headsup.i was (?am?) on Emily's personal permanent ARC team. i got arcs for PW and the novellas. i've never recieved mails surrounding this release, so at the start of setpember i sent her an email informing what and how. her assistent and emily didn't really say anything of importance. so after 2 weeks (and about 12 emails back and forth) i finally got something i could work with. mind you, i was already almost sucking her imaginary dick. i know arcs are a privilage not a given, but she literally threw me off her arc team without communicating with me. never got an email. was never informed.anyway, i sent her proof and the only thing i got was a very passive aggressive email back from her about the fact she put me on the list again (? so she still removed me lol) and i should've gotten an email from book funnel.guess what. i never got that email.at this point i already thought i was annoying her to pieces so i just never responded to the fact i never got an email from bookfunnel and just said thank lol.once again. maybe just a mistake from her side. but it weird af, because they took 2 weeks to come to a point where they just gave up. idk wtf happened but anyway. it's weird and i asked around and apparently i was not the only one.i'll let y'all know if something changes for the next book lol-------------------One of her best books to datertc when i’m either at work or after work because i now have 5 minutes left to make myself ready because i was finishing this😭✋🏼(also be ready for some complaints about communication from a reader standpoint. has nothing to do with the book, everything to do with arcs and the author)——————i’m patiently waiting for this book while i’m also selling my soul and first born child to Emily for Pucking ever after vol 2",5
"609","200124498","oh my god!!!!!!!! this is 1010% my favorite pucking book yet, i cant even begin to comprehend how much i loved these three beautiful characters 😭i was absolutely enthralled by this one from start to finish, i truly couldve read a thousand more pages of them i never wanted it to end!! i thought the pacing was so well done and the plot to smut ratio was *chefs kiss*. i loved that we really got to know them and whats going on a little bit before we started getting spicy. i loved revisiting some of the things that happened in books 1 and 2, i thought that they were so well done in a manner that didnt feel repetitive. it brought a great new POV for those scenes 🤭i have to say i am SO SO happy that while writing PS the dynamic shifted to mmf instead of the originally intended mfm becuase colton and novy together brought such a BEAUTIFUL dynamic to the story and made it ten times stronger, i do wish we got just a little bit more one on one time with the two of them but overall just absolutely obsessed with how much it felt like it added to their story. i absolutely love the way that emily writes her FMCs, they are bad ass foul mouthed take no shit women that i aspire to be like one day. i could not have loved poppy more i swear, she is the IT girl of this series the way she handles herself and everyone else at the same time is truly something else. this will easily be one of my top reads this year, i cannot believe how in love with this book i am and i am already dying to get started on planning a reread 😭",5
"610","200124498","I know I’m going to be in the minority here and this may well be a case of ‘it’s me, not the book’. I LOVE Pucking Around, it’s one of my all time favourite books and will live in me forever, I also really enjoyed Pucking Wild, but honestly this one fell flat for me. It’s set over the same time period as the first two books so we get to see a lot of the scenes from the first two from different povs, which I actually really liked, even though there wasn’t actually many appearances by the Prices. Pucking Sweet is an MMF, but the MM doesn’t start until around 60%. Colton and Lukas are tipped as best friends turned lovers, but I didn’t really get that best friend vibe from them and when the MM part started it was so out of blue with barely any hints to their feelings for one another before they went full on into it (neither had been attracted to another man before). I also didn’t feel like I got enough of the building of the relationships between the three of them before they went into more. There was A LOT of spicy scenes (I actually skimmed the last couple), so for me it lacked the depth of really getting to know the characters and believing in their love for one another. It’s still a good read, and the last 15% or so I liked.",3
"611","200124498","As I’ve said, Ms. Emily knows how to write a captivating story. So here I am again.",NA
"612","200124498","What? How did this get into my the-list? 👀 👀",NA
"613","200124498","it was ok, I don't think anything will ever amaze me in this series as the first book, I mean MMMF? how do you even top that?",2
"614","200124498","Steamy! I don’t quite know how to summarize my thoughts on this one. The pacing was pretty good, except I was ready for the story to be wrapped up around the 70/75% mark. I feel like there were a few plot points in that last 30% that could have been skipped or happened earlier with the same effect. I wish we would have spent more time focused on Novy and Cole falling in love with one another. It was pretty subtle, which to some level I appreciated, but it did feel like their love story took a back seat to each of their relationships with Poppy. I did like each of the main characters, and feel like they were well rounded and fleshed out people. The plot thread of Cole’s dad passing was completely forgotten about, and Novy’s abandonment issues were a little brushed over. All in all though, a fun read, very steamy, and no prose or grammar things to complain about, which is always appreciated!",3
"615","200124498","This was indeed pucking sweet!A steamy, sports-romance, with a dynamic mix of humor, emotional depth, and sizzling chemistry. The characters are well-developed, and the storyline offers both heartwarming and intense moments, centered around hockey player relationships.I really enjoyed this one - so hot, sweet, and funny👌",5
"616","200124498","I received an ARC copy of this book and I DEVOURED it in less than 24 hours! This was everything I’d hoped for and more. These characters have my heart! Their love story is beautiful and I fell for each of them. The emotional pacing of this book is perfection. Nothing felt rushed or “too soon,” but flowed organically. Emily is a master at writing characters that are easy to relate and connect to, whether you identify with their struggles or not, you still root for them completely. The way this story weaved into the first 2 books was beautifully done. Even if you haven’t read the first 2, or PEA vol 1-2 (but you should because they are amazing), you can totally enjoy this story on its own. Poppy is life. I want to be Poppy when I grow up. Novy is the sarcastic, prankster grump with enough emotional baggage to rival Poppy’s literal “I packed way too much for this trip” baggage. Their dynamic and banter was sassy and wonderful. The sweet Colton is a gentleman in the streets and was a pleasant surprise alpha in the sheets. The way he connects with Poppy and pines for her made me swoon. And I loved the friendship between Colton and Novy. And when that spice hits… Y’ALL!! I love the way each spicy scene flowed organically with the story. It’s never spice just for spice. Each encounter shows you more of their relationship, dynamic, and emotional development. It was beautifully done. And there are definitely little tidbits/scenes mentioned that I am going to need written into the next PEA! 😁I’ll admit, I didn’t think anything could top my love for the Price family, but this group is up there with them. I didn’t want to stop reading, I want more of this world and my Jacksonville Rays!",5
"617","200124498","emily we must have words😩this book did me in! i never know what to exactly expect with miss rath’s books but i am never disappointedi can’t even lie, at first i was shocked when i realized the timeline of this book starts allll the way before pucking around and wasn’t really feeling the idea, i was trying to get right to the good stuff but getting to see everything slowly develop, seeing other POVs to certain scenes and moments were everything this book had endless ups and downs (i should not have been gasping for air the way i was at the 97% mark😭)i laughed, cried, screamed, and hollered, yet it all just made for an amazing reading experiencethis little family means EVERYTHING to me and i’m so happy with the story they got side note: pucking ever after volume 3 is going to hit SO damn hard, i need it desperatelyside side note: the set up for the next full length novel????? now THAT is tea",5
"618","200124498","100 ⭐️Oh my freaking god. I feel so sorry for myself that I read this book so soon after its release, BECAUSE NOW I HAVE WAIT WAY TO LONG FOR THE NEXT BOOK. This book was A MA ZING, oh my god. I sent screaming voice memos to my bestie Chey almost every chapter with updates and the emotions I was going through. I thought Pucking Around was great, but Pucking Sweet, oh dear heavens... I can't stop thinking about it. I'M SO SAD I CAN'T RELIVE THIS AGAIN.",5
"619","200124498","2.5 stars, rounded up to 3. Unfortunately, this wasn’t for me. I loved PA, PW, and all of the novellas, so I was so excited for Poppy’s book. However, because it follows the same timeline as Pucking Around, the plot felt recycled and there were just a few new scenes sprinkled in; but it felt like I was just doing a remixed re-read of the other books. Novy has so much potential that was missed because he won’t go to therapy. Poppy is the same sassy spitfire we’ve come to know and love throughout the other books. Colton had more depth than I was anticipating and he deserves a happy ending, just maybe not this one…. The end felt extremely rushed and abrupt. This throuple is one of the ones that would definitely end up divorced or split up very quickly if nothing changed. Thank you to the author and team for the eARC. All thoughts are my own and I appreciate the opportunity to read the advance copy.",3
"620","200124498","OMG, Pucking Sweet was EVERYTHING I wanted from a Jacksonville Rays book AND MORE. One of my most anticipated new releases this year, I was SO thrilled when I was able to get my hands on an ARC. Pucking Sweet is laugh-out-loud funny, incredibly spicy, and oh-so-heartwarming it made me giddy. And the END! I SOBBED, it’s PERFECT 😭. Y'all don't even know, and I cannot wait for you to find out!I related to Poppy SO hard - definitely the most ""me"" character in the Rays universe. She's driven and a little dramatic, but when she decides she's going to let loose, she goes ALL IN 😏. I absolutely loved that she is SO committed to what she wants, whether its her job OR the two men she falls for. Though she can verbally spar with the best of them (Novy) and is VERY comfortable not taking no for an answer (her ""lean in"" moment with Mark Talbot had me yelling YOU GO GIRL👏🏻👏🏻), I appreciated that she could be vulnerable too. By FAR my favorite FMC I've read in a LONG time.Y'all, I've been incredibly loyal to Team Jake since the first time I read Pucking Around, but I might have to switch my allegiance and buy a new jersey - I'm kind of in love with Colton🥹. He's so sweet, kind, and attentive, the perfect person for both Poppy AND Novy. Colton is really the glue that holds this throuple together. Novy, on the other hand, is a straight up wild card. He's incredibly entertaining to read, and his antics had me cracking up more than once. While he has a tough exterior, his insecurities broke my heart - Novy had the most work to do on himself, but he ends up being all-in by the end.The coolest part of this book was the fact that most of the book runs parallel to events every Rays fan is familiar with from the other books. Seeing each one from a totally different perspective was SO MUCH FUN. Every time a scene I knew popped up, I'd get a little giddy, because while I knew SOME of what was about to happen, it was a blast seeing it from an entirely different lens.Bravo @emilyrathauthor. Pucking Sweet is hockey romance perfection 🤌🏼🤌🏼. I literally couldn't ask for anything more... except for more Rays books (I'm VERY excited about Pucking Strong y'all).",5
"621","200124498","I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this series. I don't like some parts of it but I love other parts. This book is in the middle because I didn't like some scenes but really enjoyed others. I couldn't it down despite how annoying the characters could be at times. I liked Poppy, Lukas and Colson but I didn't connect to them as much as I did with other characters in the series (well I kind of loved Poppy but not the guys). There is definitely a lot of spice in here and in my opinion it impacted the emotional connection between Poppy, Lukas and Colson. This book also has a suprise pregnancy (which I know is definitely a unpopular trope but I actually love it) but it doesn't occur until like 60 percent in. This is exactly what I expected it to be, which is a fun, addictive and really spicy hockey romance. It focuses more on hockey than most other hockey romances though as Poppy is the PR manager of the Rays hockey team and there's actually quite a few hockey games that happen, which I like. I love how diverse and unique this series. There is so many different types of representation for people that don't often get represented in books and other forms of media and I love to see it. Also Poppy's family drama is really bad (I thought what I've been going through lately in my personal life was bad but this is on a completely other level). I could relate to her having a difficult relationship with her mother but my mother has never manipulated or tried to control what I do in my life. Also Poppy's ex is absolutely awful (the things he says to her are absolutely awful and should never be said to anyone) and I'm glad he gets what he deserves.",3
"622","200124498","This book needs editing and a publishing company that will tell an author no when they want to cram 400 story lines into one novel.",2
"623","200124498","RATING: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ +♾️SPICE: 🔥🔥🔥🔥Hello favorite book of the year! I have been wanting and begging for Poppy, Novy and Morrow's story from the first moment I fell in love with the Rays universe, and these three were perfection. They were messy and chaotic but still absolute perfection.Plus someone needs to apologize to Caleb Price, because Colton Morrow might be my favorite thing ever. But then again, I love them all, and in this universe I don't have to choose.TROPES ✨ Hockey Romance✨ MMF and Polyamory/ Bi-Awakening✨ Accidental Pregnancy✨Friends to Lovers✨Enemies (who want each other) to LoversI really don't have words to explain how these fictional characters have burrowed their way so far in my heart, but this book was an utter delight from start to finish. I laughed and I cried, sometimes at the same time, and I fell in love with the relationship that Poppy, Novy and Morrow formed.Poppy St James is the Jacksonville Rays resident PR Barbie, and I love this woman's fierce Southern Charm, her feistiness and her resilience. I also loved how Cole and Lukas both brought out different sides of her personality. It was so evident how much she needed them both and how much they needed each other, even if they fought it for eons. Lukas is the bad boy that you just have to love, he's got a tender underbelly, but in order to get him to show it, you have to go through 10 layers of f*ckery (and I mean this in the very best way). Thank goodness for Cole Morrow, because this man is as sweet and stubborn and they come. He is a Leo through and through and the absolute needed calm in the storm that is Poppy and Novy.I can't find a single fault with this book, other than I immediately want more. The spice was fan freaking-tastic, the banter was absolute next level and the emotional parts... well I sobbed quite a few times. I just loved it and had over 400 tabs and highlights, so it’s safe to say this one deserves all the stars in the sky.",5
"624","200124498","Why do i keep continuing this series.",2
"625","200124498","3.5 ⭐️ I think I'm going to sit with my thoughts for a while... Maybe I overhyped it in my head, but this one has ended up being my least favourite in the series so far, and I had HIGH expectations, let me tell you. I knew that this was an unplanned pregnancy MMF romance, so I was kind of holding on to see where it would go... but I didn't love it. Poppy seemed so put-together, an absolute badass barbie in the other books, but here, I just couldn't really see her that way. Colton is everything. He's THE absolute gem in this book and he CARRIED it till the end. Lukas was... idk, I'm sure he'll be someone's dreamboat, but to me he was just annoying about 75% of the time. I don't like pranks or the whole 'chirping' thing, so he was really just infuriating. And I mean, Poppy felt the same, she was just also really attracted to his a**. Somehow. And, much like with book 1 with Rachel and Ilmari, we don't see any MM (meaning romance between Colton and Lukas) until about the 70% mark. What is that? Also, I thought it was cannon that Lukas Novikov was bi, but apparently I was wrong. I may do a more in-depth review after a little bit, but this book was... not what I was expecting. At all. It also made me realise just how much the Rachel/Jake/Caleb/Ilmari relationship timeline is just a full-on speed-thru lol. 🌶🌶🌶.5/5 - This is very much in line with the previous books. Super spicy, but mostly sweet too.",3
"626","200124498","Pucking Sweet was the right name for this one! Poppy's story with Novy and Marrow was indeed sweet and so loving. It was fun to go back to the same timeline as Pucking Around and see how their story was evolving at the same time. I loved getting the details of the bits and pieces we were given in the other books. There was a good mix of plot and spice, plus a lot of character development with each of the main characters. I love getting to know more of the Rays players and organization. Marrow and Novy together were the absolute sweetest. I love their love for each other and their love for Poppy. This was such a good addition to the Pucking Around and Rays world.",4
"627","200124498","Story: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Spice: 🌶🌶🌶🌶.🫑 We get to go all the way back to the beginning. Emily starts us from ground zero of the Rays, except now we are getting Novy, Morrow, and Poppy's stories. I absolutely adore how the Rays universe interconnected, and we get little snippets from everyone's stories and BTS with the new POVs. We all hate a love triangle romance novel right...?! So the beginning of this story is rough...well kinda the MMCs are friends from when they were younger (teens) so they aren't complete and utter dickwads to each other (phew). But there are ultimatums thrown out along with the ever popular ""I don't share"" and bless poppy's southern belle heart she is just smitten with both men. The moment Novy and Morrow come up with, let's call it ""Plan Poppy"" is epic, I love the moment from PA that turns the light bulb on for the guys like ""Holy shit other people are doing this"" 😂 and full green light Plan Poppy. Even though Poppy was raised in the south and without a doubt an uptight family, she doesn't seem to have much shame or guilt with her sexual preferences. I liked that she was just okay with wanting what she wanted..instead of a whole waffling situation over ""what will people think"". Morrow is our golden retriever hero. Novy is our angsty black cat who needs love.The way that Poppy rounds out the team is perfection. Talk about perfection the way Coley and Lukas' relationship develops from friends to more....I'm at least glad the guys told poppy's family where to shove it because her mom definitely deserved a cunt punch at minimum. Whos the real MVP of this story...Tina. Mother fucking Tina. Honestly...I wanna marry her. I hope everyone has a Tina in their life who's ALWAYS willing to be the getaway driver. Oh, lastly, I LOVE an accidental pregnancy. So full 100/10.",5
"628","200124498","Woo! What a rollercoaster that was! Pucking Sweet is full of the banter, love, and laughter you can expect from a Jax Rays book from Emily, and and let's not forget the spice and tension before everything comes together. I devoured 500+ pages in 2 days, I could not put it down. I laughed, I cried, I screamed and I absolutely loved every second of it. I loved all 3 of them individually but even more as a whole. They've all got such different personalities but they all mesh together so well. I let out a sigh of relief when they all finally got together cause love triangles are not for me. I already loved Poppy from seeing her in the previous books. I love a strong, badass boss woman. She knew her worth and potential and left the ""perfect"" life her mother had paved for her and she made her own success. Lukas/Novy...I love him. I just want to give him all the love and take care of him. When he's talking to Cole about emergency contacts? My heart just broke. He's a big bad defenseman and he doesn't see his worth. He hides behind his image and doesn't let anyone get close. Poppy and Cole break through his walls and we see how much of a sweetheart he actually is. Add to this the fact that he had me dying with laughter throughout the book.Cole is just the sweetest. Without any spoilers, he didn't his issues define him or stop him from becoming one of the best defensemen in the NHL. The jealousy and possessiveness when they thought Poppy would choose between the 2 of them? H-O-T. I'm really not a fan of love triangles though so I'm so beyond happy that this is an MMF. And speaking of, Cole and Novy?? I died. Shoutouts to Tina for being an amazing friend. And shoutouts to the bachelorette party for bringing us the bingo scenes. There's so much more I want to say but I hate reviews with spoilers so this will not be one of them.I recommend this book and this entire series if you haven't read it already. The Jacksonville Rays have my heart. 5/5 ⭐4.5/5 🌶",5
"629","200124498","THIS IS AN ARC REVIEW AND CONTENT MAY CHANGE WHEN PUBLISHED. DNF@28% can't do it anymore and, again, 100% on me. I think this is not my prefered genre of reading and I don't know why I'm insisting. I'm proud to have the romance, particularly with smut, genre being one of the reasons I picked up reading again, but it's time to move on from bad or nonexistent plots. That's not to say I won't be reading it anymore, especially rereading some of my favorites, it's just time to acknowledge that it will be on a back burner for now.Ok so, I DNF'ed the second book of the series as well, so this comes as no surprise. Rachel and the boys' story was my favorite, and the author's regency series are so good, but this is not working for me for a while now. First point is: all of the MC's are the same person. They talk about signs the same way, feelings/sentiments and dealing with them the same way, going on and on and on AND ON and I am 100% sure it's that way for the rest of the books, because that's what the author is known for: rehashing. In this book specifically, though, what grated me most, and it is something that the author prefaces: this is in no way shape or form how a professional PR person acts and should act. Even with the previous warning, it still didn't feel right enough to be ok with it. It feels like it's making fun of a serious profession, and stereotyping the women who work in the field and the men they work for and with. Come to think of it, it was the same with Rachel and the guys. A positive point is the author always has their CW and TW on point.",NA

I loved the vulnerability that everyone showed throughout the entire book; how Rath always handles LGBTQIA+ love is so incredibly wonderful and respectful.

"636","200124498","⭐️⭐️⭐️Okay… okay, I really wanted to love this… but I have some thoughts…Here are my credentials: I loved That One Night and I LOVED Pucking Around and the Pucking Ever After volumes are just delicious, including The Dentist, which are some of my favorite words ever strung together. Pucking Wild wasn’t my favorite but that was mainly because I couldn’t connect to Tess, not because I disliked the plot of the book or her story with Ryan. Pucking Sweet Thoughts1. I get the instalove/pining that happened between Poppy and Colton, but Novy’s development of feelings for Poppy were like a flip of a fairly unbelievable switch. They hate fuck and then suddenly he’s “all in.” Please. 2. We have ice machine sex, elevator sex, a glimpse of handcuffs and then…. Quickies for the rest of the book? This was not the spice demonstration that Dr. Rath has demonstrated in the past. It was like the second half of the book was phoned in. 3. Dirty talk was 100% recycled from Pucking Around, identical between the men, and very repetitive. - “You’re going to wear my cum. Understand?” - Not only is this honestly a strange (and cringe) thing to say, but it’s weird to have 2 characters in the same book talk the same way… as well as other people that they know but haven’t had sex with (Caleb)… the “Understand?” line particularly kills me because it’s so singular and should only be used in one scene, let alone eight scenes across multiple books. 4. In a similar vein, PLEASE DR. RATH, can we stop if the “you’re mine” and “you’re ours” and the “claiming” that occurs on every other page. People just don’t talk like this and there are other ways to demonstrate possessiveness. I cringe every time and I hope she moves past this in her writing style soon. 5. Dr. Rath said the MM aspect ending up surprising even her and… it shows. The complete romantic timeline between the men begins with that shower scene and ends in that other shower scene. And then when they do have penetrative sex “on screen” it’s only once and completely breezed over. Their love story felt very backseat to the MF storylines and it made me sad because I was actually most interested in the men’s side of the love triangle. 6. The entire storyline of this book is fed through the events of other books and it makes Poppy’s love story feel pieced together like a patch job between other, more main characters. Maybe it’s just me, but they felt like they got B Team writing and effort, which is why I gave this book 3 stars.",3
"637","208457093","becka has done it again!!! the angst, the humor, the found family, THE LOVING OUT LOUD. this book was perfect and I loved every second. 𝙨𝙮𝙣𝙤𝙥𝙨𝙞𝙨jaxon is the notorious bad boy enforcer. he doesn’t do relationships and definitely doesn’t do love. he’s been burned and left by any one who matters. lennon is trying to figure herself out after walking in on her pencil dick ex fucking someone at their rehearsal dinner. when the two cross paths at a weekend away in cabo for a perfect one night together, it’s great. they’ll never see each other again. but then lennon walks into the arena as the team’s new photographer. and THEN her apartment floods and jaxon offers her a place to crash. so begins their delicious descent from sorta hating each other to wait a second… 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨 & 𝙛𝙚𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨one of my favorite things about becka’s books is the way she writes characters who love their person with everything they got. whether it’s the little things like pink tulips on the counter each to the big things like ensuring the house has an observatory, I always feel the love permeating from the pages. the found family in each and every playing for keeps novel makes me cackle and literally cry for how much each of these characters love each other. the vulnerability and safe places they are for each of them to land. jaxon and lennon had such a beautiful love story. lennon showed up for jaxon and he showed her what love really was supposed to feel like. 𝙛𝙖𝙫𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩I’m but a basic girlie and I have to say the stargazing scene where jaxon opens up to lennon about his best friend, bryce. tears were STREAMING down my face. “𝙒𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢?

"643","208457093","i think i may have found my book of the year 🥹 becka’s writing is just so special because it manages to be funny, hot, and entertaining while also having characters and storylines that pack an emotional punch and jax and lennon were no exception for me. they meet while staying next door to each other and after spending a tipsy yet unforgettable night together, lennon leaves without a trace the next morning. they never expect to run into each other again… until his hockey team gets a new photographer that’s none other than his one night stand that he’s been yapping about nonstop. the gang is so funny and sweet in this one. jaxon’s character will send me to therapy okkkk. if you’ve ever felt forgotten, unimportant, or invisible in your life, you will love jaxon and the lengths they all went to to show him how much he was loved made me cry on several occasions. the banter between jax and lennon was EVERYTHING. i will never get sick of a fictional man who likes to tease and argue with her but then quietly does the sweetest things for her. jaxon was an acts of service girl’s dream and i cannot stop thinking about all the ways he quietly showed his love for her. this whole series is like a hug from your best friend. it’ll take you through every emotion and i really think there’s someone that any reader can identify with in this cast of crazy characters. these eccentric, goofy, hockey boys are not for everyone but they are certainly for meeeee!!",5

"646","208457093","(To safety gang readers)If you want to read this, start from chapter three.(Spoiler for the first two chapters only)You can skip the first chapter it’s unnecessary (MMC with OW and no detailed sex)Chapter 2 the OW leaves the H's ass because he can't remember her name and on the same night he has a ONS with the h (the h room is next to the H & OW room and she hears them having sex multiple times for 3 days 🤢. He also tell the h that he had threesomes and foursomes and had sex in public places. I would stay away from him but the poor girl hasn't had an orgasm all week so she easily falls into his arms).MMC & OWOW : Brielle
  “Fucking on the beach, in our private pool, and on our deck. Bent over the bed, up against the wall, and on the bathroom counter.” I brush a long gold ponytail off a flushed neck. “I’ll spend the week fucking you any way you want, anywhere you want.”Her blue eyes twinkle as she twists back and forth. “Your treat?”“Of course, my treat. I’m rich, aren’t I?”She bites back her grin. “That’s what Google says.”I resist the urge to roll my eyes, only because I rarely get time off during the hockey season. Despite her having clearly looked up my net worth, I still want to spend my limited vacation time buried in something hot and wet. I’m certain she’ll do the trick.“You haven’t even asked my name.”Oops. “Haven’t I?” I trail the tip of my finger along the strap of her sports bra, down to the dip in her cleavage. How is this flimsy thing holding those girls up? “Guess I just feel like I really know you, you know? It’s like you’ve always been a part of my life.” Fuck no, but I hear my friends say shit like this to their girls all the time. “You just fit.”“oh! I’ll have to go shopping. I have time to go shopping, right? I wanna get a new bikini for you.” She spins into me, tossing her arms around my neck. “Maybe I’ll get a spray tan. That way I’ll have no tan lines.”I’m about to ask her if it’ll rub off on me while I’m fucking her, because no way I wanna be orange, but she keeps going. Of fucking course she does. She talks a lot. It’s annoying, but not unbearable. If I keep her mouth busy most of the week, we’ll make it out just fine.
FMC & MMC & OW
  “Newsflash, Brielle! He’s been telling you to shut up for the last three days!” Our neighbor shakes her head, and that claw thing buried in her hair somehow detaches, clattering to her feet, where she stoops to pick it up, curls springing free and bouncing around her face. “I’m done. This is supposed to be my honeymoon, and you two are ruining it for me.”“Honeymoon?” I lift a brow. “Honey, I hate to break it to you, but typically you bring your significant other on your honeymoon.” My gaze coasts down, then back up. She doesn’t look thoroughly fucked enough for my liking. If she were my bride, she’d be in bed all week on account of her legs no longer working. Instead, she’s been sunning on that deck for the past three days, tablet in her hands, curls piled on top of her head, buds in her ears, probably listening to some podcast about the art of homemaking or some boring shit.Her mouth scrunches, gaze narrowing. “I’m requesting a new villa.”“Good luck with that.” This place was sold out seven months ago, but maybe she can find a . . . standard room. Shudder. “Don’t let the door hit your ass on the way out, honey.”
FMC hears MMC & OW having sex multiple times
  It’s quiet. Too quiet.The first half of my week was like this. Blissful. Peaceful. Quiet. Ever since Thing One and Thing Two showed up three days ago, it’s been anything but. I swear, the only time those two stop fighting is to fuck.And oh boy, have I heard it all.Jaxon has magical fingers. A magical tongue, and, apparently, an incredibly magical cock, based on the way Brielle hasn’t been able to stop screaming his name.Is that how I also know her name? Oh no. I know her name because she’s been shrieking it at him every time he fucks it up and calls her some version of Breanne, Breanna, or Brenda. He seemed to learn well enough after the first forty-eight hours, settling on baby.I swallow against the desire lumping in my throat, the one that reminds me I’m supposed to be the one getting fucked into the floorboards, and he looks like he could do it well, no matter if his voice is enough to drive me to drink. 
MMC & FMC
  “Don’t you have someone else to annoy?” I grumble.“Nope.”“Tall, blonde, big tits, loves screaming your name?”“Nope.”“Did you knock her out with an Ambien or something?”“Shit,” he breathes out. “Why didn’t I think of that sooner? Nah, she’s gone.”“What?” I lift my head out of my hand, start to spin back to him, and the second I catch his self-assured smirk, I turn away again.He grips my stool, spinning me back to him. “Breanne left.”I spin away. “Brielle.”“Yeah, her.” He spins me back. “She’s gone.”I kick at his stool, spinning again. “Wow, you chased her out of the country. Good for you.”**********“Please.” He pushes my hand away. “As if I wanna subject myself to your loud mouth all night long. I’ve just had the week from hell⁠—”“You’ve been here three days.”“—and the last thing I’m doing is getting into bed with another stage-five clinger.”I gasp. “How dare you. I’m not a stage-five clinger. I’m not even a stage-one clinger! I don’t cling, period. And if I did cling, you’d be the last person I’d cling to.”“You tryin’ to convince me, or yourself?” Hazel eyes move over me in a slow sweep as he sips his drink. “Where’s your lucky other half anyway? It’s your honeymoon.”**********“I know you’re on your honeymoon, but you’re here alone.”“And I know you arrived three days ago with a girlfriend, and now you’ve got no one.”“She wasn’t my girlfriend.”“You brought someone who wasn’t your girlfriend on vacation? Here?” I look around, palms up. “We’re at an exclusive resort. You rented a honeymoon villa, for fuck’s sake, Jaxon.”He grins.“What are you smiling at?”“You, saying my name. Bet you hate that you know it.”
Later they had ONS on the same day the OW left, it’s so gross to me…MMC and his friends about FMC & OW
  Emmett and his wife, Cara, spent the week⁠—“—fucking like animals. Literally everywhere. Kitchen counter, bathroom counter, dining room table, living room couch, basement couch, the chaise lounge in the bedroom, you name it. If it supports my weight, I fucked her on it.”“That’s how I should’ve spent my week,” I grumble, shoving a gooey pastry topped with cinnamon sugar into my mouth. That was my plan when I originally invited Brenda, but by the time we stepped off the plane in Cabo I already couldn’t stand her. It was still my plan three days later when I found God inside Lennon’s pussy, but then she took off on me. Easiest one-night stand of my life, but I would’ve preferred to spend the rest of my week fucking the attitude out of her before never seeing her again.“I see you’re still bitter about being ditched by two girls on your vacation,” Garrett says.

"649","208457093","I am so done with this author. This is the first book I dnf’d in a long time. Her other books were hard to get through but this one was just the worst. First of all, all the books would have benefitted from a good editor. They were at least 100 pages too long and full of stuff that neither added to the story nor moved it along. First of all, the character. Or should I say caricatures? Carter has gotten progressively worse throughout the series and is written as the epitome of a man child hockey bro that would in no way stay faithful. He has secret phone with his hookups written all over him.Adam is just a quiet guy with a soft heart and a gigantic dick. Do Emmett and Garrett have personalities? It’s hard to say because they seem to exist only to back up their bitchy significant others. The best thing Emmett ever did was marry Cara and save the rest of the marrying population from having her decide to choose them.And let’s not forget Olivia is tiny. It’s literally her whole personality.Now to the main characters for this book. I was pleased to see a queer woman of colour as a main character but the author really did her dirty. She was reduced to two things: her hair care routine and her sexual interests. So disappointing. And she treats Jaxon so badly, considering he literally saved her life and took her in when her apartment went bust. Jaxon is no better. Walking around naked in front of a woman without her consent is the definition of sa but I guess it’s okay if you call your dick Magic Mike. Plus the author can’t decide if he is a nice guy, an asshole, an enforcer, or a teddy bear. He’s just not a compelling character. Which is sad because he was in the last book.I read up until after the Valentine’s Day part and that was enough. I can see where it is going. They will continue to have chapter’s long sex that doesn’t get any more interesting and eventually they will figure out that they are not unloveable because they (and their lame ass friends) love each other. I will no longer read any Beck’s Mack books. I have wasted enough time already.",1

"660","208457093","I love Becka Mack’s writing and I love “playing for keeps” series but all her MCs except one are such fuckboys. This one might even be the cherry on top. 🤦🏻‍♀️ But I keep reading and of course there’s a ONS. And that’s the same night he sends away the girl he went on holiday with. Wait this is all jumbled up. Let me explain. He meets the ow in his gym. He hits on her and asks her if she wants to go on vacation with him to f*ck and whatnot you know (because it’s oh-so-normal to take a stranger as a f*ckbuddy on vacation). Of course she says yes, he’s a famous and rich hockey player after all. Only he finds her extremely annoying when they arrive to their destination (hmm I wonder why? 🤔) and the only way to shut her up is to f*ck her. Something that they do so loudly that their neighbour (MFC) in the adjacent villa can hear every single sound. After three days he’s sick of her, sends her on her way and that same night he hits on the neighbour and thus their ONS! So here’s my dilemma, how desperate are you that you drop so low as to sleep with a guy whom you’ve been hearing “loudly” with another woman for the past three days! Some meet ups in contemporary books are just freakin’ OUTRAGEOUS!!! Sorry Becka Mack but this is waaaaaay too much. Aaaaaaand the MFC reads a threesome romance book. Why???? 😩😩😩😩 romance authors are stooping sooo lowwwwwww… should I keep reading? 🫣I’ve forgotten how bad mouthed they all are. 🙄 Snippets of that: Cara is cheering on her husband who’s about to score. “Go, baby! Do it for the blow job!” She winks at the MFC “I’m gonna blow him even if he misses” All that in a full stadium. The MFC is facetiming her parents. They mention her cheating asshole ex, and encourage her to meet someone new on the hockey team. In comes her cousin: “ yeah Len, surely there’s at least one cute player there that’s caught your eye. Why not let him dick you down good?” In front of her parents!!!! Is there no limits anymore? Is this how people nowadays talk in front of their parents? Am I living on a different planet? He meets her for the first time after their ONS at the conference room in the arena. He’s shocked, his friends know of his escapade of course, one asks: “so that was the girl you met in Cabo?” To which another friend answers: “that was the girl he F*CKED in Cabo”. And it goes on and on. Every interaction between the MCs is him reminding her how well she took his c*ck, how her p*ssy is aching for his tongue, fingers and “Magic Mike” because yeah he named his little (not so little) dude. And the WAGS call themselves “C*ck Suckers” and keep comparing their husbands’/bfs’ d*cks. 😔🥺😫😭Why did I even like this series? Ok, consider me confused 🫤 They have a wild ONS in Cabo. Then they shockingly realise they work for the same team now. She’s enraged, she’s rude and absolutely angry with him for being a f*ckboy. Heh I mean, newsflash Lennon, you literally f*cked him the first day he threw out his hookup of a second! What the heck did you expect?! Never thought I’d dnf a Becka Mack book. I mean I know there’s gonna be an angsty breakup, followed by a heartwarming reconciliation and a very sweet ending but I just can’t get past all that foul language and vulgarity. EPIC FAIL",1

I also have been writing and leaving this review for the longest time because I was still not over this book and I fear that I may never be over it so its time to man up and write this review.When I first heard of lakefront billionaires I had only read the fine print and I did not like it so I put this series on hold but then I read Ashers dirty air series and I loved it so much that I gave Dreamland another chance and tho the next two books could have been better I still enjoyed them to an extent but for lakefront Rafa's book is what caught my attention I mean?? Nanny romance?? Single dad?? And Julian was being hyped up as well so I was like oh well let's read his book and I enjoyed it quite a bit but THIS ONE?? My expectations were sky high and it still managed to exceed every single one of them 😭. Lauren Asher gave this town so much life and so much joy and one thing about her books that I like so much is the way she deals with relationships and the way she handles all the mental health reps and disabilities rep. Although, as excited as I was, I was still scared of the length...like 600 pages?? But fear not- this was so much worth it and I could read 400 pages more about them and still love it. The way she wrote made it feel so short because it was almost as if we were in it 😭 and I loved that feeling so much. Asher really made this book look like a cutesy romance book by giving it a pink cover and giving it the best tropes but this book dealt with such deep subjects and it was so much more deeper and her way of setting up mental health reps with disabilities and making it an integral part of the story but balancing it so well will always be what differentiate Lauren Asher from other authors. The flow with how the story went was so well maintained and the pacing was so well maintained and everything that unraveled until the end was truly so fulfilling 🩷
  “Loneliness might be temporary, but heartbreak? That emotional damage can last a lifetime.”
Ellie was so patient and such a deeply caring person because the things that she was willing to do for Nico and kid who she babysat often made me feel like she was his real mother. Ellie was not only there for Nico but also for his father Rafa. She was the epitome of strong and hardworking women because the things that she went through and the trauma + coping with it, being betrayed by her best friend but still rising above all the negativity and trust issues she cared deeply for the ones she loved and no, I wouldn't say that it is dumb but rather very strong of her to endure so much and still remain true to herself. I have come across so many books and none of them amazed me the way Ellies character did. Parents are the most important people in your life and feeling neglected by them hurts more than anything with all the abuse and neglect that Ellie lived through the hands of her father was gut wrenching, I loved her mother for fighting for her and I loved how Lauren showed that the trauma of that would live with you but you have to accept that stage and move on.Through Ellies perspective, Lauren also shed light on how life is not always fair to good people despite Ellie having a hard childhood, she still struggled with betrayal. Friends are the second most important people in your life and theres this trust formed between them thats almost unbreakable but truth be told you can never tell what that persons intentions are and from side you may give your all but they might never trust you or be envious of you and that is exactly how I imagined Ellies friend to be, the way she believed one thing and didnt even listen to Ellie and shut her out says a lot about her and her betraying her by releasing Ellies song about her personal trauma crossed all the lines, so, despite suffering that I loved how she still stayed how she was until the end.Finally, Ellie taking care of nico was another aspect of this book that I enjoyed. Their moments together felt so cute and I loved how Nico and Ellie shared this mutual bond of trust where they confided in each other with their secrets, I loved how Nico would fight Rafa to have Ellie back and how Nico would tell her any problem he had without any hesitation. 
  “Don’t let your fear of the past stop you from the future you want.”
Rafa, you dont know how much I miss him, he was everything to me because he had been through so much and honestly please dont let that pink cover fool you because it's so sad :*( but yeah so Rafa has a troubled past and grows up with his aunt for majority of the time and I love his aunt aka Julian's mom so much, she cared for Rafa and raised him as his own and the fact that he looked at her as his mother made their bond so special, I love how Rafa's whole story and his whole character is shaped because of her. I love her so much, you have no idea. HOnestly tho- I hated his parents no kid should suffer what Rafa did, his abandonment issues and his way if processing emotions were so deeply affected.That bitch of a wife did not help Rafa either and it not only ruined his life further, slumping it, it ruined his sons life as well and I cannot stress on how much I hate Rafa's ex-wife for that, both Rafa and Nico deserve so much better than that and I loved how he stepped up for Nico and gave him his love, did everything for him and thats what makes Rafa such a great character, He was willing to do everything for his child and the fact that he was so defensive when it came to him!! I loved it so much. I also liked how much he trusted Ellie with Nico and how he knew that whatever she was doing was the best for him. One thing that absolutely had me in a chokehold was how much Rafa changed and how we saw that change through our eyes, like if you read page 500 of the book and compare that version of Rafa to the one we meet in the first 100s you will so much change and change that I admired so much, his stages of change and the way he processed his emotions and how they unraveled through the span of 600 pages was so beautifully written and I honestly could not have asked for more, Rafa deserved every bit of this arc that Lauren wrote for him and I am so, so, so happy that I got to experience this arc of him through Laurens beautiful writing.
  “You may see a broken masterpiece but I only see you”
Nico this little baby was the most precious little thing, I can understand how complex a relationship can be with your father especially for boys its never in the middle it either to easy for them to talk to them and hang out and show their emotions and other times its very hard, never in between so it was a really unique experience to see Nico's relationship with Rafa and I loved how it healed as time passed and they spent more time and I loved how much Rafa did for Nico's vision and how much he helped them.Nico worried that his father would take too much stress would trust and confide in his Nanny Ellie who was more of a mother to Nico than his actual mother ever was, I love how much he trusted Ellie and how she kept his confidence and I like how Nico could confide in her with all matters that he wanted to speak about and I loved how mature he was for his age. Their relationship was one of the best i've ever scene.
  “He kisses the top of my head. “You may not be able to come home yet, but that doesn’t mean I can’t bring home to you.”
Julian & Dahlia + Willow They did not have as much page time but hwen they came they delivered because they were so cute and the banter that they brought with them was so fun to read, I love Julians bickering and back and forth with Rafa and I love how Ellie and Rafa got along!! I love these two so much. One more thing that I liked about Julian was how much of a constant he was in Rafa's life and one thing in his life that must have felt normal, so I love him for that!! Willow and Elle's relationship was so cute and fun to read about.
  “One day, I’ll marry this man, and no one will stop me. Not even him.”
The Romance I know this may get a little repetitive but I LOVED IT!! I am not lying when I say that the slow burn BURNED tf out of everything, like it was actually so slow with the tension and angst seeping off the pages. Yes, I loved it, but, I also wanted to kill myself because every 100 pages I would scream at them to kiss and they wont kiss and ugggh I wanted to bash the head together. Their relationship was so cute and complex. It was hard at first with little communication and with Rafa having trouble processing his feelings and being so deep in self guilt and anxious over his sons condition. This is where Ellie came. I loved how much she helped him and how much he helped her both were broken and both of them healed each other. There moments together felt so cute and their banter and flirting was even more cute and please Rafa blushing was the sweetest thing also the spicy scenes were few but they spiced. The romance was fully fleshed out and I loved it tbh.
  “We can want a lot of things, but that doesn't mean anything if we don't put in the effort to make any of it happen”
The plot The perfect summer romance. One Nanny, One single dad, A two week vacation to Hawaii and one son who ships tf out of his father and nanny. NEED I SAY MORE??Overall, it's my second favorite Lauren Asher book right after Redeemed and it's truly worth a shot.__Rafa and Ellie broke my 1-2 star streak 🥹___HOPING THAT RAFA AND ELLIE WILL BREAK MY 1-2 STAR STREAK!",5

  ""To those who see themselves as broken.I hope you find someone who admires your scars for what they are: A sign of your struggle and a testament to your strength.""
This was hands down one of my most anticipated reads of the year like I was absolutely dying to get my hands on it! And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The book delivered on every level with a captivating storyline and well-developed characters. The writing was exceptional, and the plot was executed with immaculate precision.Lauren masterfully portrayed the lingering effects of childhood trauma on adulthood, shedding light on how past experiences shape our present in the most profound way. Each page was a testament to her skill, drawing me in and keeping me hooked from start to finish.This book is a single dad romance set in a small town near Lake Wisteria and is the second book in the Lakefront Billionaire series. Although it's a rom-com, it addresses serious topics like anxiety, trust issues, self-harm, and depression. Lauren’s handling of these themes is commendable, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The only drawback for me was the length; it felt like it could have been shorter. However, this shouldn’t stop you from appreciating the greatness of this story.In this book, 
  Ellie,
 the female main character, returns to her town after being betrayed by her best friend, Ava, who stole her songs and released them under her own name. Heartbroken, Ellie has no choice but to move back home. She finds a job as a nanny for 
  Nico,
 a sweet boy with an eye disorder retinitis pigmentosa  that sometimes affects his vision and they quickly bond over their love for music.The male main character,
   Rafael,
 has been deeply hurt and betrayed by his first wife, 
  Hillary.
 Her betrayal left him depressed and doubting his self-worth, but he does everything he can to make his son happy, which is something I greatly admire about him. For the first eight months, Ellie and Rafael try to avoid each other. That changes when Nico invites Ellie on their summer vacation to Hawaii. As they spend more time together, avoiding their attraction becomes increasingly difficult. Will their time together bring them closer, or push them further apart? ╰┈➤ 
  Rafael lopez
Rafael Lopez is a man who deserves nothing but immense love. Growing up with neglectful parents who never truly cared for him, he developed a coping mechanism of people-pleasing in a desperate bid to earn their love. However, this did not last long as they abandoned him, breaking him even more. He learned to hide his emotions, influenced by his sick father who claimed that showing emotions made one weak. Consequently, Rafael adopted a tough exterior, never letting anyone see how hurt he truly was.Later, his uncle and aunt adopted him, but this didn't change Rafael. He continued to believe that he had to be perfect to earn their affection, even though his uncle and aunt loved him as their own. The tough childhood left deep scars, making him feel the need to prove himself constantly. And when his dumb wife Hillary left him for another man, he was completely shattered. Yet, he maintained his strong exterior for the sake of his child, striving to give him the best childhood possible. I truly admire Rafael for this resilience; despite everything he endured, he chose to heal rather than pass his trauma onto his child.Then Ellie came into the picture, although Rafael initially tried to avoid her, he eventually stopped denying his feelings and accepted his love for her. His character development is remarkable; he worked through his emotional baggage step by step while also being a devoted father, which is incredibly challenging. What I truly love about him is his caring and loving nature. He would go to great lengths for the people he loves. Despite his own suffering, he did everything to be a good father, and if that isn't strength, I don't know what is.— ""My son is the best part of my life, and I will slay every single one of my demons to make sure he doesn’t have any of his own.""╰┈➤ 
  Ellie Sinclair
This woman embodies true strength, and I adored her from beginning to end. Ellie faced immense challenges: an abusive father who tormented her since childhood and a mother who fought fiercely for custody to protect her. The mental abuse Ellie endured led her to self-harm, even as her mother tried to be the best she could be.Even after escaping her father, Ellie struggled with the trauma he inflicted. Years of therapy helped her stop self-harming and focus on her dreams. However, her trust was shattered when her friend stole her songs, leaving her betrayed and forced to return home. Taking a job as Nico's nanny, she found solace and joy in her new role and in the sweet boy, though she kept second-guessing herself. She dreamed of being a songwriter but lacked the courage to start again. Rafa, ever supportive, helped her overcome this fear, motivating and cheering her on. Their mutual support was truly heartwarming.Ellie had always had a crush on Rafa since high school but never confessed, fearing rejection. As she worked for him, she realized he was more than just the perfect boy from school like he had his own set of flaws, which only deepened her love for him. While her character development wasn't as highlighted as Rafa's, her resilience and strength were undeniable. What truly stood out was her love for Nico. She loved him like her own, which takes immense strength and made me admire her even more. Ellie's journey of healing, growth, and love is a testament to her incredible character, and the way she and Rafa supported each other was beyond beautiful.— ""I don’t want to stop doing things I love because I’m scared.”╰┈➤ 
  Ellie and Rafael 
I can't emphasize enough how these two were meant to be together. The chemistry, banter, and sexual tension between them were beyond perfection, and I was totally here for it. Initially, they both experienced tension—Ellie hiding her crush and Rafa denying his feelings—but avoiding the inevitable was impossible.What I truly admired was their growth. Despite their tough childhoods, they never let that affect their love. They always tried to communicate during hard times, and even when they didn’t speak, they understood each other and i feel only few books that i have read were able to showcase this level of understanding. Rafa did everything to show his love for Ellie, and Ellie always stood by Rafa's side, knowing he often shut himself off. She always reassured him that he wasn't alone and they were in this together! Their ability to work through their inner thoughts and discuss their fears and discomforts without holding back was remarkable. No matter the outcome, they faced it together. Their journey of mutual support, love, and growth was truly heartwarming.— ""With her in my arms, I’m happy and hopeful. Like I’m no longer stuck in reverse because I found the brightest star to guide me out of the dark. Elle Sinclair.""— ""So long as Rafael and I are together, our love song will remain incomplete. Like a melody with no pause or a song with no outro. We’re a story without an ending… And I wouldn’t want it any other way.""╰┈➤ 
  Nicolas Lopez 
And how can I not mention my sweet boy! Nico, even though he's just five, he speaks with the wisdom of an adult. He had me cracking up at the things he would say. I absolutely adored his relationship with Ellie. My heart went out to him as he dealt with the life-altering diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa at such a young age. Rafael and Ellie made sure he experienced as much as possible before his vision deteriorated. Nico's maturity for his age was touching, and watching him grow and figure out certain things pulled at my heartstrings. His relationship with Rafael was strained at first, but seeing them mend it was truly heartwarming.— “I love you more than pianos, superheroes, and Duke Brass.”“Wow. That’s a lot of love from such a little guy.”“Papi says I have the biggest heart he knows.” Second-biggest heart to exist, right after his father’s.I absolutely loved the theme of found family in this book. The appearances of Julian and Daliah were wonderful, and the addition of Willow and Cole brought even more warmth to the story. I especially cherished the deep friendship between Ellie and Willow, as they were always there for each other. The way Ellie and Rafael were surrounded by so much love from their family and friends added so much depth to the narrative and truly made my heart feel full.This book took me through a whirlwind of emotions that I wasn’t expecting. Although it was quite lengthy, I believe the length was necessary for the story to fully explore and resolve their issues realistically, without feeling rushed. This extended depth only added to my enjoyment, as I found myself completely engrossed in every moment.°˖➴ ""Overall, this was my most anticipated read of the year, and it absolutely delivered. I'm already eagerly looking forward to the next book in the series! So if you’re in the mood for a story that will make you giggle, kick your feet at 3 a.m., and also bring tears to your eyes from its sheer sweetness, then this book might be perfect for you. Enjoy!""  💌‧₊˚🖇️

I hope you find someone who admires your scars for what they are: A sign of your struggle and a testament to your strength.""If Lauren writes it, I will read it. This was one of my most anticipated reads, and it delivered all of my expectations. I knew that I could count on you to get me out of my slump.Love Unwritten is the second book in the Lakefront Billionaires series. It is a small town, single dad x nanny, grumpy x sunshine romance with witty banter, tension, and a slow burn that is so good. Don't let all of this fool you as there are some heavy topics that are discussed such as negletful and loss of parents, mental abuse, and self harm that takes you through the process of healing that is navigated with so much care. There were moments that made me shed tears while others had me giggling and kicking my feet.Ellie is an aspiring songwriter who moved back to Lake Wisteria after her long term friend since childhood stole a song that she wrote. She is offered a job to be a live-in nanny and music teacher for Rafael's son Nico. They avoid each other as much as they can for the first eight months. That is until his son invites her to go on their summer vacation to Hawaii. Now, they are finding it difficult to avoid one another. Will the time together bring them closer, giving into their attraction towards one another or push them furrher apart?Eleanor ""Ellie"" Sinclair my precious girl is broken from having dealt with mental abuse from her father from such a young age, leaving her with trauma as an adult. She is compassionate, strong, emotional, has trust issues, and even has a jealous side, which I loved to see. I loved her from the start. I resonated with her on many things. One is that she is emotional because I myself am an emotional person. I cry over almost everything from being angry to upset and can try and blame it on being a cancer, but that's not it entirely. Ellie, like me, is terrified to fly. I don't have anything bad to say about her. I loved watching her character grow and begin to trust again and overcome the trauma that she has been dealing with for so long. “I don’t want to stop doing things I love because I’m scared.”Rafael ""Rafa"" Lopez is broken in so many ways from having grown up with parents that were negletful to having trust issues from a marriage gone wrong. He tends to hide his emotions from others due to the trauma that he has developed from his father, telling him that showing his emotions makes him weak when he was a child. He is so much more than all of that. He is caring and protective, and guys he saves animals. That had me swooning over him. I loved watching him work through his past baggage that haunts him and figure himself out to be better for not only himself but for his son and Ellie.The process of his growth was slow, but I felt that it needed to be as it felt so raw and real. In real life, you don't overcome these things quickly they take time. ""My toxic trait isn’t the fact that I don’t have feelings; it’s that I feel too much, all at once, so I suppress it instead of learning how to cope.""Ellie and Rafael started off with tension between the two of them due to everything they have both been through in their lives. They push each other's buttons, but with all of this, their chemistry is off the charts. Rafa does the sweetest gestures for Ellie, and he calls her ""mi estrella,"" my star that had me swooning so hard. I loved the witty banter between them. The communication between them is on point even though neither of them want to discuss certain things at times. I loved that they worked through their inner thoughts and were able to discuss their fears and the things that made them feel uncomfortable without holding back no matter what the outcome may be. I can connect with this as I'm sure many others can as well. Where we have a pep talk with ourselves so we can try to elimate any miscommunication. In a sense, they grow together while growing separately, and I loved every minute of it. I will stand up for and protect both of them always. “You are the one I never knew I needed.”“I may not be the one you envisioned for yourself, but I won’t stop until I feel like I’m worthy of you.”“You’re the one I was always meant to find.”Nico Lopez is the sweetest boy ever I swear. He had me cracking up at the things he would say. I adored his and Ellie's relationship so much. I felt for him having to deal with a life altering diagnosis of rerinitus pigmentosa at such a young age. Rafael and Ellie made sure that he was getting to see and do many things before it progressed too much, and he lost his vision. He was so mature for his age and watching up, growing, and figuring out certain things pulled at my heart strings. His and Rafael's relationship was strained at first, but watching them mend it pulled on my heartstrings. ��I love you more than pianos, superheroes, and Duke Brass.” “Wow. That’s a lot of love from such a little guy.” “Papi says I have the biggest heart he knows.” Second-biggest heart to exist, right after his father’s.I loved the found family in this so much. I enjoyed the appearances of Julian and Daliah. We were introduced to Willow and Cole, who were both good additions to the story. I adored the friendship between Ellie and her and how they were always there for one another. Both Ellie and Rafael are surrounded by so much love from their family and friends, and seeing it made my heart feel so full.This book put me through so many emotions that I honestly wasn't expecting. It was long, but I feel like it needed to be in order for them to work through all of their issues and not be rushed for it to feel realistic so it didn't bother me much. I enjoyed this so much. I was eating up. At first, when I read the epilogue, I thought that it needed more only to discover that it wasn't done yet. Then I read the extended epilogue and Rafael's epilougue that had me in literal tears and completed the loose ends, leaving me satisfied with how it ended. This book has become my favorite from Lauren to date. I can't wait to see what else she has in store for us. Favorite quotes and moments ""My son is the best part of my life, and I will slay every single one of my demons to make sure he doesn’t have any of his own.""""I’m hit with a strong, forbidden sense of yearning for someone I can’t have but will always want.

"679","201145400","such a sob fest in the worst way possible. in an attempt to have depth, the first 30% of the book is a whole trauma dump we’re supposed to care about, and- not to be a heartless wench- but i fear i did not…no one was HAPPY. ever. it was always angst and crying, being angry and jealous, insecurities and withholding feelings; NONE of which are romantic in the least. i didn’t swoon once. my heart didn’t pitter patter. and there was no giggling or kicking my feet to be found!! i don’t think im a fan of lauren asher (from what i’ve heard, because i’ve stayed away from her books). but love redesigned knocked my socks off with the banter and cute ass moments between julian and dahlia!!! i wanted that here but was unfortunately let down :(",3

"682","201145400","It's been a complete emotional rollercoaster, and yes, there were tears.I think it's fair to proclaim this as one of my top favorite books of the year alreadyᯓᡣ𐭩 -~*´¨¯¨`*·~-Rafael is the kind of character you can't help but love, a single dad with a heart of gold who saves animals and despite his severe trust issues, when he finally comes around to trusting, cares deeply in his own unique way. His relatability is off the charts, and it's clear he's a standout favorite.Ellie, with her good moments and gentle spirit, was a decent character but didn't leave a lasting impression. The music/songwriter aspect of her story didn't quite resonate, leaving her in the shadows of more memorable personalities.Nico, the brave little boy facing health challenges far too early, tugged at the heartstrings. His story is a poignant reflection on childhood and the complexities of familial relationships—both sad and strikingly real.Burt shone brightly as a character, and Cole? He's the epitome of 'what a man' truly a character to remember. It was also a delight to see more of Julian and Dahlia, and the anticipation for Lily and Lorenzo's story is through the roof.Willow was the quintessential best friend, and even the brief mention of Callahan and his family added a nice touch, also references to F1. However, Hillary's character fell flat, her greed and lack of maternal warmth making her less than favorable.In the end, this book is a solid 5 star journey. Despite its length and a few snags along the way, it was devoured in just a day and a half. Rafael and Ellie's dynamic is potentially one of the best from Lauren Asher, and their family portrait is nothing short of beautiful. This one's a tearjerker for sure ᡣ𐭩the epilogue🥹 >>also the bonus scene ft Elías Cruz and Jax Kingston💓 >> would definitely recommend giving this book a shot! -~*´¨¯¨`*·~-𝘴𝘰 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘴 𝘙𝘢𝘧𝘢𝘦𝘭 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰𝘨𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳, 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘵𝘦.

"684","201145400","4.5 rounded up, i’m so very excited to say that being back in lake wisteria was well worth the wait & anticipation 😭i was lucky enough to receive both the arc & alc for this book and let me just tell you, NEITHER disappointed. listening to Rafa, Ellie & Nico be brought to life was e v e r y t h i n g!! while this is a major “will they, wont they” slow burn you can feel the chemistry radiating off rafa & ellie from the very beginning 🤭  To those who see themselves as broken. I hope you find someone who admires your scars for what they are: A sign of your struggle and a testament to your strength.be sure to have tissues at your disposal as soon as you crack this baby open because while we might get some good ole tension right away we also get TEARS. just like love redesigned, love unwritten is extremely vulnerable and feelsy. on one hand we have nico and his diagnosis, everything that comes with navigating that and the other we have two broken main characters that have been fighting inner and external battles their entire lives mostly alone because they wont let anyone in to see the real depth of this until they both begin to lean on each other to heal 🥺love unwritten while extremely romantic is very plot driven. we get to watch ellie & rafa come to term with their feelings toward each other at a slow pace while the chaos of life inside their minds and out side of their house plays out around them. i have to say more often than not nico was the star of the show. that boy was so freaking adorable its not even funny, to be so full of love even after all of the things he has gone through and while knowing what his future holds is no easy feat. he was the sweetest comedic relief that we needed through out this story and i do hope that with the future of lake wisteria books that never dulls 🥹now for the reason i knocked .5 off of my rating. while i did love this book immensely i did wish that it wasnt as slow burn as it was (criminal thing for me to say yes i know) BUT i say this in the sense that because of it being single dad x nanny trope, one of my favorite things about it typically is the sneaking around/hooking up for a longer time period, stolen moments/touches, the “we shouldn't be doing this”. and i just would have loved to see more of that towards the beginning of the story. overall this is a beautifully written story about healing, unrequited love becoming requited truly deeply madly in love, and the power of friendship/family. i whole heartedly recommend 🩷i highly recommend checking out TW/CW on laurens website as there are a lot of sensitive topics though out the entire story before you get started 🩷",5

    ”A love story that has only just begun, with the best parts still left to be written.”
  
oh god. this was so bad.i can’t believe i’m saying this bc i used to be a huge fan of lauren asher’s books. she was the one who made me obsessed with F1 after the dirty air series. i have all her books at home. so, trust me when i say i used to be a really huge fan. but this? this was terrible.i might upset some of you, so if you don’t want to read my opinion on this one, pls skip it. i won’t be offended.first of all, the plot: boring.the characters? mid.the pace? slow asf.the writing? mid.the smut? non-existent.the romance? atrocious. the chemistry? pls look at point romance and smut.and it’s full of clichés and platitudes. and it was ENDLESS. i can’t tell what’s really on my mind otherwise i might get arrested. but lauren thought she did her big one, she didn’t. the thing is, lauren thinks that having conditions or issues or struggling with mental health makes the character more complicated and, as a result, likable. well lauren darling, hate to tell you this–and i’ma hold your hand–but having issues = being complicated is bullshit. a character doesn’t have to have “issues” to be liked by ppl. it’s kinda insulting for ppl who really struggle with depression, childhood trauma, self-harm or conditions in general, if you ask me. bc in this case, she used them just for the sake of the plot.nico has a condition that was not develop at all. and i really wanted to know more about retinitis pigmentosa, bc i’m ignorant on the matter and it would’ve been an amazing chance for me to learn more about it. i would’ve love to learn more about nico’s feeling about his condition, but instead,for the first half of the book, i read about a rude kid. istg if i had talked back to my mom like nico had done with rafael, she would’ve kicked my ass til her shoe and my ass would became one. idk about y’all, but my mom taught me to be respectful to my parents even when they piss me off–and trust me when i say my father pisses me off 24/7.thank god nico is not just that. he also has a big heart and he’s the only one who managed to grow on me. also, rafael was so boring, i wanted to cry every time he opened his mouth to speak. he also gave me the ick YUCK. he clearly suffers from depression and childhood trauma and–again–i would’ve love to know more–keyword: MORE–about his feelings but page after fucking page, i had to read the same things again and again like a damn broken record. SPARE ME!she justified his grumpiness and rudeness with his depression and childhood trauma. wtf lauren?but i have to say he’s such a good father to nico! it was so cute after they talked about their problems with each other. and pls rafa, fuck your woman for god’s sake!!!! instead of overreact about a damn photo!!!!ellie was so bland i wanted to head the wall repeatedly. she didn’t give me any emotions whatsoever. which is fucking sad. bc she used to suffer from self-harming and, while i appreciated the acknowledgment, i feel like idk shit about her feelings–once again. lauren acknowledged their struggling one time and then proceeded to repeat over and over the same exact thing. which ofc got me bored after 300 pages. ugh, spare me!😃🔫i really couldn’t connect with none of them bc all i know after 600+ pages of torture is that nico has an eye condition, rafael has childhood trauma and ellie used to suffer self-harming. that’s it.i would expect it from a 100 pages book, but if lauren decided to release a 600+ pages book she definitely had the time to develop certain things. also, it was supposed to be a romance book, right? WHERE WAS THE ROMANCE????i’ve read so many books in my life, so many stories about mental illness, depression, self-harming, childhood trauma, SA, addiction and so on… personally, i like to be aware and know things, especially if my knowledge can help someone else. that’s the main reason why i read books about heavy matters. and lauren and her book portrayed this very poorly. and she did it just for the sake of the plot.so no, i wouldn’t recommend this book. but if you’re interested in learning more about what i mentioned previously, i’d gladly recommend good books that deal with heavy matters properly.it was such a waste of time, it pisses me off sm. i’m fucking upset rn.",2
"687","201145400","Arguably the best contemporary romance my eyes roved over for the year. Love unwritten is an interlaced melodious story fixated on two people who are struggling with the haunting confines of their own past traumas, mistakes, and self loathing tendencies. The remedy? Hear me out - a collision Of Ellie Sinclair and Rafael Lopez , who spark a slow burning steam, alongside this soothing comfort balm of benevolence, in other words - love that takes its slow sweet ass time to a point where it felt insatiable. ""The one does exist, but not in the way you thought I meant, like some soulmate or something cosmic. To me, the one is someone willing to do everything in their power to be the person you deserve, not because they are fated to love you but because they choose to."" ^ A quote from Ellie Sinclair. A certified baddie, the best nanny, who as a matter of fact can have me 🤌. Ellie is a woman recovering from her endured anxieties of hurt and deceit. With that being taken in mind, she is also the devoted baby sitter of this little wholesome nine year old child, Nico - who is the son of Rafael. Without saying much, Ellie goes above and beyond to don the role of being this motherly love giving lady to a child that isn’t hers in the first place. The best part? She doesn’t do it for the money, but for the genuineness of her own tender heart. Without saying much, Ellie confides in music as an outlet, which translated in ginger moments of her pouring her clashing nerves out through symphonies . It was simply artful to say the least because the meaning was tied into plenty of scenes. I refuse to say more. And also she has aesthetic tattoos that delve into meaning after meaning 👏. “ I want this moment to last for as long as humanly possible. Want to bask in the look of adoration on her face and the pure sense of joy that builds in my chest when I realize I could feel like this for the rest of my life, so long as I don’t get in my own way. “ ^ A quote from - Rafael Lopez, a billionaire grump at first in the slightest, for his own obvious reasons, but gradually ends up pouring out all his confessions and underlying morales that shine light on why he is exactly so closed off. Being Ellie’s Boss - Rafael goes through his feelings of infatuation but before the love even beings to love - the best part about him was the fact he wasn’t this pretentious try hard alpha. This man was unequivocally burning with hatred, demons, and inflicted hurtful wounds that he all brings to the surface - admitting them with intense honestly that makes you go like, wow that was fucking deep. And that exactly, was what made Rafael the star of this shit. It’s honestly rare for a male lead to be written this well, so I give my praises truly here. Rafael admitting his wrongs, wanting to right them for Ellie gave the classic lover boy down right bad for that one lady love vibes - done remarkably well may I add Seeing Ellie and Rafael reveal each others sensitivity, causing them to be untrusting and hesitant and doubtful only for this magnificent push pull dynamic to take over as they both just give in uncontrollably and decide to take steps forward TOGETHER was a marvelous act of rhythmic romance that had its memorable ups and downs. Pun intended. My only major complaint that low key bothered the living shit out of me was the 600 plus page length, as I felt this story could have been a bit more reduced - but the unraveling chemistry, and character development between these two love birds was honestly so praise worthy - you can consider my criticism unwritten. 👀Five stars. “Don’t let your fear of the past stop you from the future you want.”“It’s called being happy, try it with me”. Read this. 🖤",5
"688","201145400","2.5 rounded up. I loved the first one, so I was excited for this one until I saw it was 551 pages. I was completely shocked that a book could be 551 pages for a romance? Then I realized the page count was wrong because it was actually 616 pages!!! No romance should be this long unless it has a deeply traumatizing story or thriller type story as well. I still gave it a chance.To be honest, I really enjoyed the first 450 pages which actually surprised me. Then it completely fell short for me. To be honest, this is the slowest burn and by time they actually got together, I just wasn’t invested anymore. Also I kinda had the ick from the MMC. I hate germs, so how much the food thing was discussed and them discussing swapping germs gave me the ick. This definitely wasn’t my biggest problem, but I had to mention it. For some reason, I couldn’t connect with him in general. After reading other reviews, I realized that I think Rafael was just really selfish with all his choices and that he was kind-of bland and just not likable in general.I enjoyed the story while they were in Hawaii, but once they got back, I lost interest. There should have been more romance while there & they should have gotten together in Hawaii and lived happily ever after, the End. 😂After page 450, I was so uninvested, I kept skipping over so much stuff, because I was bored. If I could rate the first half of the book I would give a 5, but to be honest it wasn’t a 5 for the romance but simply because I enjoyed the FMC, but the rest was like a 2. I really am a strong believer that kindle unlimited needs to stop paying authors by the page, because books that could be amazing are getting ruined by unnecessary length and filler.",3
"689","201145400","""unlike my other songs, this one is happy. Hopeful even. Like a never-ending epilogue of our unfinished love story. A love story that has only just begun, with the best parts still left to be unwritten.""
I think theres something to be said about two people who might feel a little broken but genuinely want to change that narrative for themselves and those they love. no one has ever looked out for Rafael and Ellie in the way they did with each other in making them feel wanted, seen, understood, supported and inevitably loved and I liked seeing that happen4.5 stars The grump in Rafael was much apparent with his self sabotaging tendencies but thankfully he acknowledges them. And yes, he had his moments! but I thought his heart was always in the right place as he sought to be a better version of himself. he’s unquestionably such an exemplary dad, who if given the chance, would take his sons pain as his own if it meant he’d live a better life. Aside from a man, who, in spite of his reclusive nature, also works to become worthy of Ellie through his trying efforts. I adored how he saw her heart before anything else so early on. I mean, the way he made her feel seen and supported? it left me swooning and I cherished that. Ellie was incredibly refreshing and had such a beautiful soul. her bond with Nico was so nurturing 🥹 the moments they had and the unconditional love between them had me in awe. her inability to regulate her emotions in the past and what resulted from that resonated entirely to my adolescence. it was nice to see the contrast there, as she had a decent grasp on them while also struggling with her own demons. i liked the fact that, regardless of her understanding and patience with Rafael—she’d put him in his place when he acted out of character lol besides making her dreams in music a reality after everything Nico was the sweetest most wholesome angel 🥺 who literally wore his heart on his sleeve. He was deserving of all the love everyone had for him as he was dealing with his own struggles and learning to live with a condition that would only get progressively worse and I’m so glad he had the support he had. there were quite a few moments where he was such a meddler and it was pure entertainment hahathe fluffy scenes we get amidst the heavy ones were rather lovely. I honestly found more value in the little things here. Without saying much, Ellie’s flight anxiety and the support there gripped my heart as i can relate. I thought the communication between them worked interchangeably well and was reflective towards their growth (some miscommunication but not with each other). Now, while I adored LR, I can’t deny this having more emotional depth to it and the slow burn was burning since things officially happened 70-80% in and I didn’t mind as it worked for them. It was ultimately beautiful seeing the characters peel back the layers to what’s contributed to their collective traumas both individually, jointly and it all unfolding as it did gradually in opening up. It made it all feel cathartic by the end and I definitely teared up a little lol i do believe the story could’ve been condensed by some pages because truthfully it did drag a little, but I also still enjoyed it nonetheless. The epilogues were soo wholesome and completely warmed my heart. I can’t recommend the duet narration enough as i felt more present with the characters and engaged with the story with how phenomenal it was! after this, I cannot wait for lily and Lorenzos book 🤭some quotes“he laughs, and it may be my favorite sound, only second to his son’s.”“Hot single dad with more emotional baggage than London Heathrow Airport during Christmas? Check.”“My son is the best part of my life, and I will slay every single one of my demons to make sure he doesn’t have any of his own.”“My toxic trait isn’t the fact that I don’t have feelings; it’s that I feel too much, all at once, so I suppress it instead of learning how to cope.”“Ellie Sinclair has always been pretty, but right now, she looks absolutely gorgeous in a floor-length gauzy white dress that highlights her soft curves and sun-kissed skin. I can only think of one word to describe her, and it is ethereal.” “The one does exist, but not in the way you thought I meant, like some soulmate or something cosmic. To me, the one is someone willing to do everything in their power to be the person you deserve, not because they are fated to love you but because they choose to.""""you may see a broken masterpiece, but I only see you""",4

This book did so many things right to the point where I was crying several times throughout this book.I have never been able to relate more to a fictional book character than I have with Ellie. Her struggles and demons she had I sadly related to in more ways than one. I thought the chemistry between her and Rafa were off the charts and the tension? THE TENSION? Gag me please or else I will not shut up.It was so beautiful to read of the mending relationship between Rafa and Nico. These two boys have bee through hell and back and in the end, they came out stronger than ever. Ellie and Nico's relationship was so wholesome and their countless scenes together just made my heart so full.I'm telling y'all right now...RUN. Don't walk, run to read this series. I was very worried that there would be ""second book syndrome"" but that was not the case at all. I found this beautiful, deep, and warming. This is such a 5 star series for me!!

where to start...? i enjoyed this book since the very first page. it drew me in. i was intrigued, and wanted to see how the story would unfold.Rafael LopezDON'T GET ME STARTED!!! this man is my roman empire. he was so caring, protective, kind, and loving to our girl ellie. he loved her in places no one else did. he saw all of ellie's 'flaws' and wasn't even fazed, he showed up for her everyday and if that's not commitment i don't know what is. rafael tried so hard to form a bond with nico, and eventually he started blaming himself for the divorce with nico's mother hillary. rafa marry me😭🛐 but nothing was wrong with him from start to finish. he is definitely the man any girl would dream of.Ellie Sinclairshe is suchhh a great fmc. she had emotional depth and was fun without being annoying. we watch her self love and confidence grow throughout this story and it was beautiful. i don't have much else to say about her 😩 i admire her•̩̩͙*˚My Thoughts˚*•̩̩͙＊i enjoyed this one more than love redesigned i think. i need to do a re-read on that one though! i definitely did love this book, and was a sucker for all the cute moments. but the more i read the more i felt like something was missing. i don't know what but there just wasn't that... pop. the story is beautiful but.. like i said.. i feel like something is missing i think this is a book everyone should read at least once!! it's heartbreaking but well worth the therapyalso, i literally saved so many quotes so when i get that 3am motivation you'll see my review with 282993 quotes (i would say your welcome, but it'll be you with the tissue box 🤷🏻‍♀️)the reason's why it's not 5 stars;✎ the book is too long tbh✎ i didn't care much abt everything w/ava so it felt dragged at times✎ the miscommunication✎ felt like something was missing (mainly this one)reason's why i loved it; ✧ rafa, and nico. no explanation needed.✧ the emotional intimacy ✧ the single dad x nanny trope ✧ the amount of emotional depth✧ how they learned to trust and love each other despite all their trauma+ so many other things!!!the 282993 quotes:

(omegaverse)other thoughts:- the plot of this book was so silly and serious at the same time. the pageant coordinator/head (regina) & another competitor (anne (her niece), were suspicious throughout the entire book: trying to embarrass her, saying so many mean things to her, threatening her crown, etc. and it got so annoying. at the end, when ava & jaime got their revenge & anne got outed, it was a relief. - loved that there was no 3rd act breakup- orange cat!!!- smut was okayyy...overallthis book is an easy, fast, and fun read!! it was only in the 300s, and the plot was pretty interesting. the characters were not annoying at all and really cute together. however, that's the exact reason it's just a 3 star read. it was fun, cute, etc. but i love some 🤌🤌 emotion & deep stuff 🤌🤌 in my books. please read this if you want a cute & sweet romance <3 - pre-readeveryone's been hyping this up sm so i'm very very excited 🤭🤭",3
"700","216657877","Passenger Princess by Morgan Elizabeth5/5 starsThis book is pure and utter joy! Good heavens it's been awhile since I read such a delicious, sweet and incredibly funny book. I was grinning throughout the entire book. Ava and Jaime stole my heart and I was rooting for them throughout the entire story. The book starts with Ava winning Miss Americana. She entered on a whim to help and support her best friends, Jules and Harper's, businesses. Because Ava is a pure light she won over the hearts of all Americans and won the competition. She is endlessly positive, hopeful and inspiring. She chose to support small woman businesses and on her Miss Americana tour she will visit businesses in all the states. Regina, the one who helps organize the competition, and Anne, a competitor, hate her guts. Regina hates her free spirit and constantly threatens to take her crown away. Same goes for Anne. She is vilely jealous that she didn't win and is degrading Ava anywhere she can. That night Ava is celebrating her crown with her friends when she spots Stella. One of her girl's boyfriends is a nasty piece of work who refused to come that night. He is a huge Atlas Oaks fan. And when they spot the band Ava wants to get a picture with them to make the boyfriend jealous. Ava knows Stella, the wife of Riggins, the lead singer. But their huge, wide and muscly bodyguard doesn't let her in the VIP area. But Ava isn't easily deterred. She and the bodyguard instantly start to banter and flirt. And gosh I was so ready for that. I was grinning from ear to ear! They were so darn cute together. Eventually Stella notices her and they are allowed into the VIP area and secure the much wanted photo. Ava also is getting nasty messages and has been threatened several times. So the competition arranges a bodyguard for her. And that bodyguar is Jaime, the bodyguard of Atlas Oakes. Before they meet they don't know who the other person is. So when they realize they have to spend three months together the fun begins.Ava is grinning like an idiot, she is a huge flirt and Jaime is growling painfully. I just love this story so, so much! Ava is free spirited, fun, outgoing and I love who she pushes and pokes Jaime. Jaime is desperately trying to stay focused and professional. But ever since he checked her bum out the night the met he kinda lost that battle. Their banter, flirting and attentiveness is so infectious. I was on cloud nine the entire time with them.And I adore Jaime's blushes throughout the story. It doesn't diminish his masculinity. He is just so sweet and kind and takes care of her every need. And when Peaches the tiny kitten enters the story I melted even more. Peaches and Jaime were just ... sigh. I don't have the words. They are the cutest thing I read about this year! I also adore the phone calls Ava had with her friends. And how Jaime's closest people instantly see how head over heels he is before he even admits it to himself. I absolutely love all the positive messages in this book towards women and femininity. We are more than our looks. It's okay to stand up for yourself and defend yourself. I love how Ava breaks barriers and empowers the children she meets in this book.This book is an absolute beast of joy and I love it from start to finish! 5 huge stars from me for this wonderful book!",5

"702","216657877","3.5 ⭐Hmmm, I have to be honest and say that I only enjoyed the first 60% when there was obvious tension and chemistry between them. And the push-pull game was so hilarious, moreso Jaime for trying to fight it off. But when they finally gave in to the attraction, idk, I felt slowly losing interest and didn't care much for the remaining parts of the story. 🫣Anyway, brief background: Ava (26) wanted to help her two best friends promote their businesses, and they think using an influencer would pave the way for that. But they didn't know anyone, and they thought it would cost them a lot. So when she saw an ad for a beauty pageant, she didn't hesitate to join, and luckily for her, she won on her first attempt. She was finally able to help her friends' businesses, and this has become her platform while traveling all through different states as the reigning beauty queen: to help promote SMEs. While it's a good thing she won, the first runner-up and the head organizer didn't like her, or even the fact that she won the crown. They're bitter about it and hellbent on making her forfeit the title. There were so many rules to uphold as Miss Americana, but the most ridiculous, I think, is not being able to date for three months while she's on tour. Therein enters Jaime (35), her assigned bodyguard, who was instructed to keep Ava in line all the time. Well, with forced proximity, tension, and attraction, I guess readers know how this will go. 🙃Like I said at the start, I did have fun with the first half when they're doing the push and pull game. Ava was so ridiculous; I love her sunshine-y personality and how she always pushed Jaime's buttons in the most comical ways. Jaime, on the other hand, was a grumpy judgmental prick in the beginning, but that slowly changed when he realized and saw that Ava's a good person and not the entitled beauty queen that he assumed her to be. He did a lot of swoony and sweet things to make up for judging her without reason. And lucky for him, she didn't take seriously all the bad assumptions that he had about her. 🤷‍♀️While he's a softie for her, Jaime was indecisive as heck because he wanted to protect her, but she's also his number one distraction. So there were times where he would give in to the chemistry between them but would back off the next, and this frustrated Ava a lot. So when they went to a bar, she had enough of his pulling away and asked him what he really wanted, and instead of answering, Jaime walked away without saying a word, when in reality he just needed air to think. And when he got back inside, he saw her talking and smiling with a guy, and this solidified his decision to finally admit that he liked her and wanted to be with her. And by this point, idk, I already lost interest in them. 🫣 I think I was only living for their banter, but when they finally got on the same page, the banter became little to none. Also, I had it already on my mind who's responsible for the threats that Ava is receiving, so the revelation was kind of anticlimactic for me. Then the ending felt like it came out of nowhere. Idk, she decided to start a business teaching self-defense, which she herself isn't good at. I love the idea, but it's not her, at least not like two months ago. She only enjoyed the concept of self-defense when Jaime was with her, and all of a sudden she wanted to be an instructor. Idk, it just felt out of left field. 🤷‍♀️Anyhoo, for the most part, I had fun with it; that's why I rounded up this to 4 stars. The banter was so entertaining, but I think it was Ava who carried the book for me. Don't get me wrong, Jaime was a good character too, and I enjoyed the things he did to show how he felt sorry for being a judgmental doofus. They were cute as a couple, but Ava made this story more fun (at least for me). Also, it's me being greedy with the epilogue, but I didn't like that it has a HFN where he proposed to her. Ngl, although it was really sweet and swoony, I still need something more than that, like, years later type. 😅 Setting aside my issues, I still think this is a good light read with cute MCs. 🤭Book info:- Grumpy x Sunshine- Age gap (9)- Bodyguard romance- Opposites attract- Mention of stalking / receiving online threats- No cheating, OWD, separation (once they're together)- OMD (not really, but she talks to people, some are men, and jealousy drives Jaime crazy. 🤭)- Gal friendships- No V (no info about their past)- No condoms, she's on BC- HFN (2 yrs later, engaged)",4

She pushes the norms and is the moment. Very confident, she knows what she wants and who she represents. Jamie, the grumpy bodyguard, is incredible. The things this man did for her, after giving in to her flirty sass was perfection. Looking after the cat and setting up her seat for long trips had me weak. Don’t even get me started on this man's mouth and bedroom antics. I loved these two together as they had great banter and chemistry. I will say the culprit behind the sabotage was predictable, and I'm a little gutted we didn’t get that book scene he tabbed played out. Lastly, at times I felt some lines and words were repetitive throughout the book. Other than that another great read by Morgan.

She had my heart completely entranced by this bodyguard romance. Ava and Jaime were polar opposite in personality but were exactly the right match for each other. Ava was just crowned Miss Americana. She was a wild horse who didn’t fit the mold of a typical pageant princess. She joined the contest to help her two best friends further their careers and dreams, and it worked. Now, Ava gets to go on a cross country tour supporting women owned businesses. Unfortunately, there are people in the organization that will do anything to take away her crown. When a bodyguard is hired to keep her safe and keep her in line, Ava will do everything in her power to befriend him. The last thing Jaime wants to do is follow a pageant princess around, but once he gets to know her he can’t stop his attraction to her.

She’s super confident and incredibly smart but also has her moments where she’s a bit delusional.

I loved this part so much because she really cared about her friends and their businesses so much she made a change in her life in order to help them more. Jamie is a grumpy broody bodyguard and I loved his character so much! I adored the things he did for Ava to show he cares while also trying to maintain the professionalism. The cat was definitely my favorite in the story because peach really brought out a softer side to Jamie and it was so cute. The mystery culprit behind the sabotaging and threats was definitely predictable but I do think it played out nicely still.

(well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was “if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that, then scroll away. do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite frankly hilarious stupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to delete after screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing. for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash. it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy. and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable prince krabs kai is, when i should just be able to infer from what the author implies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes. if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes: knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl - mhm wow what a great idea, it's totally not going to get your dumb ass killed. aaand now they’re playing thumb war. sorry are we sure this dude is the future enforcer?➳ “what i should have done was laugh in his face before making him go down the staircase first, but i’ve thrown caution to the wind and hastily replaced it with curiosity.”yeahhh great idea, go down a dark, damp, dank, dirty, dusty, secret stairway with a guy you're not even sure you should trust. greaaat idea!!➳ “it’s really quite simple,” calum says. “the majority of us will finally all gather together, and we’ll show the people of ilya who we are and what we have to say. show them that we are not a threat while also reminding them of who they have been killing for decades. the king is going to have to either admit his lies about the ordinaries or simply give us our freedom. and you are going to help us do it.”ahhh yess so simple - it totally won't lead to a bunch of deaths, lies, revelations, and another book.➳ “i can practically hear sadie blink behind me. she’s clearly stunned by his lack of concern, especially after seeing the two of us dancing together only minutes ago. i would be stunned myself if i wasn’t so used to seeing his masks—if i didn’t recognize the cold one he’s just slipped on.”every.romantasy.ever because GOD FORBID A MAN SHOW HIS FEELINGS➳ “yes, we are opponents. yes, i am the future enforcer. yes, I’m a killer that has no right to want to keep her. but there is something else, something that has her refusing to admit this confusing connection we share.”wannabe mafia lord who?➳ “something begins burning inside of me, but I ignore it, not bothering to acknowledge the jealousy painting me Ilya’s kingdom color.”i- ..no comment➳ oh, but little miss paedyn gray over here was no better. every part about her needed a special mention (or two). even her ass! “as soon as my ass got numb from sitting on that bloody stump, i stood and paced circles around our camp before splashing cold water from the creek on my face and body. then my ass got cold, and i moved next to the fire to lie down on the hard ground i’m so familiar with.”narcissism who?? this was my daily reminder as to why fictional ya books don’t include the part where they have to deal with bodily functions out in the wild. ➳ and in regards to the trials aspect, it had no real point. our only explanation was that the elites were being killed off in an arena to display their oh-so-original powers despite us constantly being that the elites' lives were more valuable. what the fuck?? someone introduce this author to world-building immediately. it would have been much more understandable if it were all the ordinaries to battle to the death, (despite this already drawing a lot from the hunger games) and then you get your one oh-so-precious girl who goes through a makeover, has two guys lusting after her yada yada yada [insert all your favourite 2010 dystopian references here]. i honestly wouldn’t have even minded it, and i would have eaten it up immediately.➳ if anyone is interested in more of my points, i wrote a very long paragraph in message 192 on page 4 of the comments section below. it's also one of the many pages where you can find me breaking my promise to myself to not respond to idiots on the internetmoving on, let’s go back to paedyn seeing as my love for her runs so deep!she’s katniss’s not-like-other-girls cousin who decides to insult the fuck out of you the minute you’re stood in a 2-mile radius to any guy. i wanted to claw her eyes out when she began with her “play the part shit” - which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree. ANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine! now for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the book by far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*he was bland as fuck omg. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!(i was going to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩after this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless. update: there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳ illéa ilya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else ➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

    ”if i am to be her enemy, i want it to be because she loathes herself for wanting me.”
  
➷ powerless follows paedyn, a cunning and sassy street thief from the slums trying to make ends meet with her best friend. this is set in a world that went through a great plague — the majority of people who survived (the elites) were graciously gifted powers to them by the plague and those who didn’t (the ordinaries) were banished or killed. in pae’s kingdom, ordinaries are inferior to elites, and the king ordered for all ordinaries to be eliminated to preserve his elite society. paedyn is an ordinary who pretends to be an elite and poses as a psychic so that her true identity is not exposed. but when paedyn saves prince kai she finds herself thrown into the purging trials, a deadly competition held to showcase the elites’ powers — the one thing paedyn lacks.i know this book is heavily compared to Red Queen and The Hunger Games, but as i haven’t read neither of those books i can’t make any comments on that. — there is no better feeling than when a book is so good you simply can’t put it down and you end up staying up late reading it. this book had my attention gripped, especially the last 100 pages!! 1 more page turned into me finishing the whole book at 2am. i needed a fun, light, banter filled romantasy to help with my slump and this is exactly what this book delivered, both of the main characters had me in the biggest chokehold. yes this book was very tropey but it didn’t ruin my reading experience as the author cleverly wove in the tropes into this story without it feeling like she was shoving them down your throat. she did also mention that she wanted all of her favourite tropes incorporated into this book. 
  
    “she’s so stunning, yet so stubbornly oblivious to how the sunset behind dulls in comparison to the vibrance that is her.”
  
➳ paedyn: right off the bat i absolutely loved pae, her sharp tongue and her even sharper mind - i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!! ➳ kai: the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!! — what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮‍💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!! 
  
    ”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”
  
— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect. this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!",4
"726","75513900","4 stars 'Who did this to you' BOY 'why do you care' GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot! This story was quite interesting, and I can't compare it with Hunger Games because I haven't read that series, but it gave me Shatter Me vibes (as in powers and some scenes).• Kingdom of Ilya is divided into two types of groups, ELITES (with powers) and ORDINARIES (powerless). Elites were gifted with different powers because of a PLAGUE, and the ordinaries were banished from the Kingdom because they're rumored to lessen the powers of the elites!The plot was plotting and IT WAS SO GOOD 😌 though, this book had a lot of repetition (flirting and banter), and was def tropey, it is still SO CUTE! The ending was so angsty, and I DAMN WELL KNOW THAT THE NEXT BOOK IS GONNA BE FULL OF ANGST!😭
  Kai Azer
 — PRINCE WHO KILLS PEOPLE WITH NO POWER, BUT IS OBSESSED WITH THE GIRL WHO'S POWERLESS!!!!! What else do you want??? He's so hot for fuck's sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES. 😮‍💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her. like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and...... HE WROTE ON HIS HAND ""she said I can touch her when I'm sober"" WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 😭🧎‍♀️His character was kinda giving Aaron Warner vibes because HE'S A FREAKING WIELDER (he can wield anyone's power if they are near) also MAJOR DADDY ISSUES 👺
  Paedyn Gray
 — I'm sorry but EW NAME 💀 She was cool, the way her fighting is described is amazing, and it was easy to imagine! How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn't quite hit me much just like Kai's.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞ yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger. THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I'm so glad she wasn't horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn't happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely. I won't say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick me Hermione Granger vibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying 'Gonna stab you in the heart' was literally the 288262th time. She's Vicious little thing as he called her. (reminded me of Violet)❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞• Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn't sense any power from her. Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she's without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editor otherwise everything was fine. This series has a lot of potential! I can't wait for book 2 ughhhh 😭 I. WANT. THAT. BOOK. (because it's gonna get super angsty and Kai is out for blood).🩸🗡⤷

"727","75513900","UPDATE- IT'S BEING ADAPTED INTO TV SERIES?! OH MY GOSH ~•~•~That ending hurt. A lot. *deep breath* Okay let's get started with the review.  I absolutely adored this book.  The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I'll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless. ✔️ Magic system✔️ Forbidden romance✔️ Angsty slow burn✔️ Mutual pining✔️ Knife to the throat✔️ Tending to scars✔️ ""Who did this to you?""✔️ He kills for herThe book imo  starts off a tad slow  but it's completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.  An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn't a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.  I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone's expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed. I absolutely LOVED the characters  and the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.  Kai  is going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don't even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he'll do anything to keep her alive and safe.  Paedyn  is no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.  The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.  I get some people are on the surface cause it's YA and don't really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you're gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn't find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn't change a thing about it at all. The side characters,  Kitt in particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn't come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don't mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn't meant to be, it's going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.  The ending was predictable imo.  I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn't completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one. Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y'all waiting for? Give it a read!!  Like Powerless? Read these-  1. The Hunger Games2. Spark of the Everflame (Kindred's Curse) 3. The Serpent and the Wings of Night (Crowns of Nyaxia) ~•~•~ IT'S TIME Y'ALL! LET'S GOOO",4
"728","75513900","dnf p.308do you ever have the feeling while reading that a book is trying too hard to be something it isn’t? to phrase it simply 'powerless' has zero originally in it. the book is a replica of many popular books, such as The Hunger Games, but make it a cheap and bland AliExpress version. it consisted of recycled scenes jam-packed with tropes that the author was unable to mold to enhance and improve the storyline with. In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was 'why the trials?'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn't. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)the writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of ”blue eyes"" not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared that Kai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king's speeches were not as majestic as they should have been. the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn't the author incorporate any other colors into Pae's character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother's inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other. how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren't that attached to the protagonists in the first place?⚠️⚠️⚠️spoilers i did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king. ——-here we go..",1
"729","75513900","you should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷‍♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle. i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn't take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!",2
"730","75513900","3 starsit’s time to be honest. let me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. so this review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻 (please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games. while some readers probably want that, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline. (i have not read red queen, so i can’t compare to that one.)powerless has every popular romantasy trope possible.  you may love that and feel fulfilled by that. i do enjoy certain tropes, but relying on tropes leaves a lot of world-building and natural character development to be desired. the writing wasn’t bad, but the typos were. though they don’t detract directly from the storyline, noticing one always pulls me out of a book a bit. hire a new editor lauren, you deserve better!!! 🩶there was so. much. tension.  if men said the things in real life that kai says to paedyn, we would have no need for romance books. however, there was so much tension and banter to the point of becoming repetitive and literally putting me into a reading slump. (kind of a me problem, too, but i’m going to put a little blame on the book.) i think lauren has a lot of growth ahead as an author and i mean that as a compliment. i do look forward to the next book and really hope for a more natural story (not too trope-y) with more original development in the storyline. there is SO MUCH potential here.

"731","75513900","did i honestly read the same book as everyone else?!? because i seriously doubt it. nor do i think an editor did.there is just no way i can give this 5 stars, like it seems to be getting left and right. and heres why.the lack of editing is seriously criminal for a big publisher like simon and schuster. so many continuity errors, so many grammar mistakes, so much awkward and unrealistic/unnatural dialogue from page 1, so many odd skips and jumps in the narrative. this honestly reads like a wattpad story that was hastily written and posted at 2am without a second thought.heres the thing though. these kinds of these can be overlooked and not take the reader out of the story IF the reader is thoroughly engaged. and i just wasnt. its not original by any means. ive read this kind of plot so many times before, it has so many overused tropes, and i could predict any sort of plot twist from the very beginning. so, because of my lack of interest in the story, the editing mistakes were the nail on the coffin that made me just not want to deal with this story any more. i didnt hate it, but its just not a book i would personally consider good or enjoyable.not for me at all, but im happy so many people could overlook the writing issues and get hooked on the story!↠ 1 star",1
"732","75513900","Updated Review: Wow. I just want to say that I have been with Lauren since the beginning of her TikTok. I watched almost every live and I remember the day she said, “I’m gonna write a book.” It’s truly inspiring to see her hard work and creativity pay off. A decent debut in my opinion. For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.  I will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters. This story felt a lot like the Red Queen in terms of general plot but I did like her personal touch, however it was on the borderline of copying rather than “inspired by” if you know what I’m saying. I believe that this book and this world that Lauren has created has so much potential and I can’t wait to see what she does next.",2

  🌸 dedication to my loves 🌸
i wanna start this review by thanking my (irl) best friend ever, raya, for forcing asking me to read this book <3if she didn’t basically shove this down my throat, i fear i never would’ve met the love of my life. and thank you, for listening to my endless rants, and responding everytime i spammed you at any and everything that happened. ilysm 😽🎀also this was a br with anna, who i love and adore so so much hehehe ty for reading this with me pookie. GIGGLING WITH YOU ABOUT KAI WAS THE MOST FUN THING EVER 😩 he’s just too perfect i’m glad we could admire him and enjoy this book together 🙁🫶🏼
  🪻plot 🪻
this book follows our favourite girly, paedyn, who is an ordinary. she is, as the title says, powerless. in this world, there are elites, who possess all kinds of abilities. and ordinaries, well, they’re left to die. the elites compete in these yearly competitions called “the trials.” where they take part in different challenges, battling eachother, until one winner remains. but when paedyn, an ordinary, saves the prince’s life, she is selected to go on the trials and must pretend to be a psychic (as her power) to not be killed.
  💐 my thoughts 💐
🎙️rant: at firstI didn’t wanna read this was bc i expected it to be like fourth wing. thankfully, it was not. think tbh the reason i loved this so so much is the nice balance between fantasy and romance. I don’t read much fantasy because im a romance girly but this satisfied me so much. not to mention i was helplessly in love with kai the whole entire time, so that introduced a little bias heheh. 🌏 the world building: it wasn’t confusing at all, for once I actually understood what was going on instead of them having the most twisted storyline with the craziest names that you can’t even pronounce. I definitely think this is a good book to get into fantasy, and if you actually wanna see romance and not just crumbs
  🫂 romanceeee 🫂
yall I guarantee you this will be the best banter you ever, ever read. it’s too good. they bounce off eachother so well, they flirt SHAMELESSLY and we love to see it hehe.“Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?” I laugh loudly. “That’s been my goal all along, prince.”lets ignore the fact that she does stab him in the back.. and think about how cute these two are 🤭🤭 seriously one of my new fav couples, the most chemistry ive seen in agess. if this book wasn’t so damn stressful, I’d reread this book until I have it memorised, but I think I’ll just go back and read my fav scenes. 
  🩶 kai azer 🩶
i think i read like 10 chapters, and then immediately ran to put him in my book husbands shelf. I was that confident he was gonna eat, and tbh, without him this is just a mediocre book.“Mark my words, prince, I will be your undoing.” I lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as murmur, “Oh, darling, I look forward to it.”like come on, how do you not fall in love right after that? if it were me, i’d fold the minute he called me darling. but hey, pae is strong, and we love that. she literally beat all the elites without any powers? that’s just embarrassing for them. i would crumble after task 1. not even after, like five minutes in.
  🗡️ paedyn gray 🗡️
she’s my fav kind of fmc. so strong, but also super funny? and has a backbone which we love.only thing I didn’t love is how badly she treated kitt. believe it or not, I actually liked him. he was kind, he was sweet, he just wanted his father to love him which like who doesn’t you can’t blame him for that. I hope he gets a good ending, maybe not with pae BECAUSE KAIPAE FORVER!! but like in general I don’t want him to die or anything. I get that she didn’t like that he looked too much like the king or whatever but they’re literally so different I think she should’ve given him a little more credit <3
  🧸 adena 🧸
my precious girl. I love her so much. she was so kind and sweet, so caring for paedyn, and the way pae actually forgot about her kinda broke my heart. I don’t think I’ll have it in me to read her novella tbh it’ll hurt too much. but I adore her, and I wish I had a friend as compassionate and amazing as her 😭🫶🏼
  💌 quotes 💌

Especially because I wouldn’t want to mess up that pretty face of yours, darling.” She all but rolls her eyes at me. “That’s funny because I won’t hesitate to mess up your pretty face.” I smirk. “I knew you thought I was pretty.”°˖➴ She is the embodiment of a bad decision. The twin of danger and desire. The fine line between deadly and divine.°˖➴ I’d never thought about what my favorite color was before. It never seemed important. Not until I looked into a pair of ocean blue eyes and realized that perhaps drowning was a beautiful thing.°˖➴ She’s a flame, and I’m going to get burned. An ocean and I’m going to drown.°˖➴ Why did I ever think I could have her, ever think she would have me? Because beasts don’t get the beauty.

you must go read this!! if this review didn’t convince you, idk what will. i’ve seen loads of people say this is just a copy paste of red queen and hunger games, but unfortunately i haven’t read them to confirm. but maybe if you like those you’ll enjoy this too? or hate it bc it’s basically the same thing LMAOOI love kai and paedyn, and although july is so far away, it’s also very close! so it’s nice knowing I have something to look forward to when I finish hiatus <3happy reading pookies 😽🫶🏼MWAH ILY….i feel like crying. and screaming in frustration. bc that ending hurt and suddenly july feels way too far. im going to need the most cutesy, happy, feel-good romcom to help me heal from the insane amount of anxiety i had reading this ❤️‍🩹 5 stars. rtc <3",5
"746","75513900","Disappointing. More than disappointing. The hype for this book infuriates me because if this is the standard, the standard is in hell. It was basically just an amalgamation of popular tropes, and the main character was a carbon copy of every other generic YA lead to exist, lacking any flaws whatsoever. Where’s the originality? The world building? The character development? A good romance requires more than a few tropes and loads of cringey banter. Further, the writing was ridiculously poor and underedited.",1

  ⚔My Thoughts⚔
Usually I am not into reading slow burn romance books. Like if they have a friends to lovers trope I’m not really interested in it bc its so slow at least in my opinion. Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it's just hard to wait that long i’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉 BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn't really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!! 
  ⚔Main Characters⚔
☘Pae☘This girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn't even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖☘Kai☘Kai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew. 
  ⚔Side Characters⚔
The were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae 🙈 but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.

Is that what you want?” (Kai)▪︎”Maybe because you have to be a gentleman to be gentlemanly.” (Pae)“And who says I’m not?” (Kai)“I’d like to find someone who says you are.” (Pae)▪︎”Well maybe if you’d kept your eyes on the dance floor and your nose out of your glass, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” (Pae)“Oh, darling, my eyes were on the dance floor. They were on you dancing with my brother. Why do you think I’ve been drinking?” (Kai)▪︎”Do share her with the other gentlemen, wont you?” (Kai’s mom)“She’s mine for the night, Mother.” (Kai)▪︎”I could get used to you being a gentleman, Azer.” (Pae)���And I could get used to being one for you, Gray.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m a fool.” (Kai)“Only when you're around me?” (Pae)“Only for you.” (Kai)
  ⚔Favorite Quotes⚔

Next time we fight, impress me.” (Pae)▪︎”By all means, carry on. I’ll never deny myself the chance of watching you watch me.” (Kai)▪︎”Remind me to make you smile like that again, when you aren’t dying, and I have all the time in the world to memorize it.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m going to ask again. Who did this to you?” (Kai)▪︎“Oh, I’m not making you do anything, darling. You can leave me to bleed out if you must. Because I only want your hands all over me if you want them to be.” (Kai)▪︎”You know. I’m beginning to think that you enjoy getting hurt, if only so you can have my hands all over you.” (Kai)▪︎”Who needs a pillow when I have you?” (Kai)▪︎”You know you didn’t have to spill my drink all over me to get me alone.” (Kai)▪︎”It’s not the winning that I find fun. It’s you, darling.” (Kai)▪︎“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.” (Kai)
  ⚔The Ending⚔
The ending was so messy and heartbreaking and I was crying sm!! 😭 Like idk what to even say. I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy. I wish I could say more but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it. 
  ⚔Hopes for Reckless⚔
🌱More Kai and Pae romance🌸The ending resolved🌱More humor
  ⚔Last Thoughts⚔
I really liked this book a lot and I'm hoping the next one delivers and it doesn't end up like the way Ruthless Vows was. Crossing my fingers for the next one only a couple months left!! 🤞💝

"748","75513900","This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases. The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here. Then there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.",2
"749","75513900","what fourth wing should’ve been29/12/23 a hit tweet! i’ve certainly sparked some discussions with this one 😀",4
"750","75513900","What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer: I know nothing of the author and don’t keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there. It wasn’t just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably. This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples’ nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above. People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games. For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up. This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise. The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense. This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense. So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite’s power overtime. Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it’s literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you’re telling me they’re nonchalantly killing them off, when it’s not even required to win the trials? I’m sorry, but I’m not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn’t morally grey, this is pure evil. Building upon the issues I’ve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes. I’m sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea—whether it be world, character, or plot based. It’s built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, the tropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression. These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I’ll just stop while I’m ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters. Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they’re intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He’s supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he’s honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I’m sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I’ve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism. The dialogue between characters is the worst. I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y’all know what I’m talking about, I know you do). The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it’ll be their romance in the end, because Kitt’s POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story. Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it’s not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there’s the door.🚪Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they’re lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I’m talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the “slow burn” trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn’t hit the same if you’ve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages. Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?",1
"751","75513900","dnf 30%I’m literally Powerless, because I don't have enough strength and power to finish this book. I'm sorry to the people who enjoyed it, but I can't keep doing this to myself despite trying to somehow like it.It felt like the author tried very hard to make this book appeal to Booktok, because the amount of stuff copied from various popular books here was crazy. At this point, let AI write books, because currently new releases lack the depth and that something that could be found in books before or when Booktok wasn’t that popular yet. Instead of being original, authors focus on putting as many popular tropes as possible because they know people will eat it up anyway. Unfortunately here, the 'eating up' part didn’t work out for me. ———— let's see if it's worth the hype",NA

"754","61242426","ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.4.5/5 starsLegends and Lattes is the wholesome and cozy fantasy you didn’t know you need.For those of you who don’t know, Travis Baldree has been well known for his role as the audiobook narrator behind Will Wight’s Cradle series. And many other series, really. Legends and Lattes is his debut novel, and I do think Baldree should now be known for his fantasy novel, too. I wouldn’t have known about Legends and Lattes if it weren’t for Twitter. Most of you probably know already, almost all of my favorite novels and stories are intense, emotional, dark, and serious in tone. But I do love slice-of-life as a genre as well. When I saw the cover art—illustrated by Carson Lowmiller—to Legends and Lattes on Twitter, with the premise indicating this is a high fantasy novel with low stakes, I knew I couldn’t go wrong with my expectations entering this book. I knew immediately I should read this when I’m in the mood for something short, cozy, and wholesome. Despite loving slice-of-life in other storytelling mediums such as manga, anime, and TV shows, I seem to struggle to find a terrific slice-of-life fantasy novel. But I got what I wanted here. Legends and Lattes is the slice-of-life fantasy novel I craved and received.
  “I told you I came across it in Azimuth, and I remember following the smell to the shop. They called it a café. People just sat around drinking it from these little ceramic cups, and I had to try it, and… it was like drinking the feeling of being peaceful. Being peaceful in your mind. Well, not if you have too much, then it’s something else.”
The story in Legends and Lattes is centered on Viv. Worn out after decades of packing steel and raising hell, Viv, the orc barbarian, cashes out of the warrior’s life with one final score. A forgotten legend, a fabled artifact, and an unreasonable amount of hope lead her to the streets of Thune, where she plans to open the first coffee shop the city has ever seen. However, her dreams of a fresh start making coffees instead of swinging swords are hardly a sure bet. Old frenemies and Thune’s shady underbelly may just upset her plans. To finally build something that will last, Viv will need some new partners and a different kind of resolve. At a glance, it's easy to advertise this as a fantasy novel about building a new coffee shop in a fantasy world, and yes, it indeed is. But beyond the surface, there were a lot of relatably resonating themes that made Legends and Lattes so precious. Through this premise and the narrative, Baldree highlighted the importance of friendship, found family, love, community, and how good food and beverages never fail. And at its core, I think Legends and Lattes is a story about starting something new. It's never too late to start something new. Will it be easy? No, it will be difficult. But it's not impossible. Growing out of your comfort zone is never easy, but good things just might come out of it. Booktube was something I was too afraid to try. For years I contemplated it, and I won't lie, I still struggle with it at times. But after more than a year, I can say that this new venture has all been so worth it.
  “I apologize. Look, I am very bad at this. I don’t really know what I’m doing… This is what I know, what I’ve always known. I just want to know something else, now. To be something else. Everything I said was stupid. I, of all people, ought to know better than to assume anything based on what you were born as. Before you walk out, do you mind if I start over?”
The novel doesn't feature multiple POV characters. The entire story in Legends and Lattes is told exclusively through the perspective of Viv. There isn't a lot of characters here, but Baldree focused on quality rather than quantity. Viv started the coffee shop business alone, and soon she will befriend new acquaintances and friends that became irreplaceable to her. It's never too late to do something new, but starting a coffee shop business on your own without anyone's help is a task that may be too difficult to execute. Cal, Tandri, and Thimble taught Viv and us readers that it is okay to believe in the kindness of strangers. As improbable as it sounds sometimes, especially to us who tasted adulthood already, not every stranger is out to get us. And Legends and Lattes remind us that there is goodness and kindness in this world. I loved reading the character development of Viv, Tandri, Cal, and Thimble. Thimble needs to be protected at all costs.
  “Right… and one thing I remember particularly well from our little chat was how much she hated assholes. You know, some people might consider any of her crew to be assholes, just because of the nature of the business. But I don’t think that way… I’ve got respect for people who have to get their hands dirty to get things done. That’s just work. No, it takes something special to be a real asshole, and I think she and I are of the same mind.”
It's not only the characters, too. Even seeing their friendship and hard work bringing results in the form of a new menu genuinely made me smile. Oh my god, the description of the drinks and the food in this book is irresistible. I actually can't recommend this book to you if you're on a diet. I want to taste the coffee, the latte, Thimblet's cinnamon roll, Midnight Crescents, and more. If you're in the mood for an epic fantasy novel with warfare, battle scenes, and an expansive world-building, then this may not be the novel for you right now. But even then, I still would recommend Legends and Lattes to every fantasy reader. I am, after all, a fan of epic fantasy and grimdark fantasy, too, and I still end up loving this thoroughly. Slice-of-life does not mean that the story lacks tension, the conflicts the characters encounter are just different than the ones we often read in epic fantasy. I mean, if you know life, you know just how stressful life can get sometimes. And the narrative never takes a pause. Baldree made sure the progressions in character development and business making always happen with each chapter. Additionally, the 31 chapters in this novel are filled with their own unique chapter icon. All of these, with the combination of Baldree's accessible prose, transformed Legends and Lattes into a page-turning—and cozy—reading experience.
  “I was just thinking that you don’t have to forget who you were… because that’s what brought you here.”
Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldree is a serendipitous novel. I didn't search for it, its existence came out of nowhere, and it instantly became one of my favorite books of the year. I have a strong instinct this book will be incredibly famous one day, sooner than later. I absolutely enjoyed it. A great book and delicious food are things in this world that never fail to make me feel happy and alive. I can't live without them. If you feel the same way, how about trying this relaxing book? Legends and Lattes is truly a feel-good fantasy novel at its finest. I eagerly wait for the next book by Baldree. I want more out of this world, and I've asked the author about his plan. Fortunately, Baldree plans to make this a series of standalone novels/series similar to Discworld by Terry Pratchett. This is most likely the best direction for the series, and I couldn't be more pleased. Pick up this book as soon as possible, and have a refreshing taste of Legends and Lattes.

The cover would have me thinking it's some sort of Dungeons and Dragons fanfic. But I don't know anything about the game, so I imagined this wouldn't be my jam. Ha, was I wrong.Viv is tired of being a bounty hunter and is hanging up her sword. The orc is settling down to the quiet life, opening a coffee shop in the city of Thune. But can she really leave her previous life behind and find success and a new home, especially in a city where she is a complete stranger and no one even knows what coffee is?Ah, this story! It's just brimming with joy and heart on every page. To read it is to be enveloped in the gentlest, warmest of hugs. You don't have to be an orc or bounty hunter to fully appreciate the themes in here—of starting anew, finding yourself and a place to belong, and opening your heart to never thought-of possibilities. It's such a core part of the human experience, and this book captured a most lovely rendition of it.But to say this story is cozy doesn't mean it's boring. To the contrary, there is excitement and tension aplenty, with all the right components to have me turning the pages as fast as I could. I wanted to gulp it down, but also to savor it slowly. I couldn't think of a single thing I didn't enjoy in here, from the characters to the plot to the writing.I can totally see why this book has gotten all the hype, and I can't recommend it enough. Now I know what you're thinking: But Yun, I don't read stories about orcs or hobs or gnomes. Well, neither do I, and look where I am. Obviously, if you only enjoy tales of sadness and misery, this book isn't for you. But if you want something truly heartwarming and delightful, then this is not to be missed.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",5
"756","61242426","I really liked the premise (DnD-style fantasy universe where a former adventurer hangs up their spurs and starts a coffee shop). It's hard to say what's wrong with it. It's not true that nothing happens (a coffee shop is opened, an adversary is dealt with) and it's not true that there's no character development (something something the power of friendship something). But it -feels- like nothing happens. This read like a NaNoWriMo effort and apparently that's actually what it was. Things happen. There are characters in the story and there sure are pages with words on them. But there's never anything unusual or unexpected or very clever, that happens. It feels like the only reason it was written was because someone needed to come up with a plot and fill 50,000 words to meet the deadline. It doesn't matter what the words are. It doesn't matter if the scenes are important. What matters is getting words on the page. Every challenge that appears is instantly and easily overcome. And every character (except two) is so gosh darned nice and reasonable and in touch with their feelings. I can understand why the people who like this book like it. We're living in scary, dark times and it can be a relief to escape into a low stakes scenario where every plot point is telegraphed ahead of time and you're never in any anxiety about the outcome for any character or of any situation. That is, perhaps, therapeutic and a nice break. But I want more, even of my fluffy mind candy novels. I want compelling plots and deep characters. Also the first half of the novel is like reading a description of someone playing Diner Dash. They leveled up their coffee shop and now it serves pastries! Leveled up again and now they have the ceiling fan upgrade! Now they have a musician. Now they're upgrading the oven.",2

A wholesome, slice-of-life fantasy that is surprisingly well done.Let me start out by saying that I absolutely do not enjoy slice of life type books. However, somehow this book really did get me interested and gave me a nice warm feeling throughout. The fantasy elements really did add well to the book, and I do not think this book would be as good as it is if it didn't include those aspects in the book. It also is trying to appeal to a crowd who likely don't normally read these types of books. I mean...when was the last time you heard of a slice of life fantasy book? This is a book about good people being nice to each other. And speaking personally, coming off reading epic fantasy books where there are typically a whole host of characters who are literally the opposite of that -- this serves as a good palate cleanser.I wasn't absolutely in love with the book, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. It just didn't have a complex enough plot for me, and it's really obvious what is going to happen in the book before it happens. But it was enjoyable and should be a must-read for any fantasy fan.

"758","61242426","I wish I could inhabit this book forever. Legends & Lattes is the comfort read version of drinking warm coffee on a long winter night. Such a beautiful, big-hearted story, one that foregrounds deep meaningful friendships and queer love between women as something that heals, something to take up against the times like a sword and shield. I have such a reverent spot in my heart for the kind of fantasy that isn’t about big extravagant conflicts, but which focuses instead on the quiet, tiny, daily moments between people just trying to eke out a decent life, capturing all the safe and easy intimacies of being in proximity of each other, of caring and being profoundly cared for, of making someplace to belong. Legends & Lattes does exactly that. In short, I know the vibes are calamitously bad everywhere in the world right now, and I’m here to say, sincerely and without reservation, that if you are in need of someplace to rest, something cozy and comforting to disappear into, this story—about a butch orc who quits her mercenary job, opens a coffee shop, and finds fierce friendship, community and (sapphic!) love in the process—is for you.",5

"761","61242426","I have officially decided to DNF this book at about the halfway point. I've read my fair share of light fluffy romances and loved them. So a no-stress, comfy, cozy fantasy should be enjoyable for me. But what was a huge miss for me was how slow the plot moves. I think something can be comforting and light while still having plot, but in this book, nothing really happens. I was also disappointed with the lack of fantasy elements. Our characters are fantastical which was fun but our main character opens a coffee shop that is akin to your local Starbucks. I think it would've been way more fun to explore magical coffees, pastries decorated like fantastical creatures, etc.Overall I just wanted more of everything. More plot, higher stakes, and more fantasy. That being said, if you know you're in the mood for low plot but comforting coffee shop vibes, this could be a great book for you.

"764","61242426","I'm about to make a statement that many will find the most preposterous thing I've ever written in a review. This will likely be deemed so ridiculous because it is (a) only May 1st and (b) a year where I've already read several books by authors like Dickens, Steinbeck and Faulkner… but I'm declaring this my favorite read of 2022.It not reasonable to even think I'll find something I like better. This is the book I've literally wanted my entire adult life. A slice of life fantasy novel, no adventure, no wars, just the everyday lives of people in a high fantasy setting doing stuff while adventures do their own thing and mostly leave them alone. It's the relaxing nature of Becky Chamber's science fiction novels but as a fantasy.The plot is just about an orc setting up a coffee shop, and the coworkers/friends she makes in the process of getting the business going. The tagline of the book is that it's a ""High Fantasy with Low Stakes"" and I love that. I know this won't be a book for everyone, I can already hear some fantasy fans sneering at the concept, but I love this more than I can possibly say. This is the most feel good book I've ever read. While there is humor, it is not taking a Pratchett comedic tone to the entire thing. It's just… well, life in a fantasy world. It's… charming to the extreme. I read it on my kindle because I had a trial of Kindle Unlimited, but I'm buying a physical copy as ell because I need it in my home library. This is a book I see myself revisiting whenever I need a pick me up. Whenever the world seems gloomy… this is a book to relax and enjoy with a nice cup of coffee.It may not be for you, but I give it a full 5/5 stars and my strongest recommendation. Oh, and I do truly hope were get a sequel or that the author at least writes another book in this same world along the same slice of life feel (even if its different protagonists doing a different type of job). I can honestly say if it does continue, it would be my favorite fantasy series.",5

"766","61242426","It all depends on your definition of 'cosy,' I suppose. I've been wrapping up George Saunders' A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life in which he takes seven short stories and dissects them for meaning and demonstration of craft. I mention this because one of the common descriptions of Legends will almost always contain variations on the phrase 'low stakes' or 'cosy.' 'Cosy,' of course, usually applies to amateur female-sleuth mysteries of a certain type, and honestly, seems kind of diminutive. Perhaps it refers to the atmosphere of a pleasant coffeeshop? Regardless, as there is no mystery and the coffee shop is a process in execution, I hesitate in that word choice. But, moving on. Are stakes low? Does nothing happen?It strikes me that what Saunders says about Chekhov's 'Gooseberries' can be said about Legends:""A story means, at the highest level, not by what it concludes but by how it proceeds... The story is not there to tell us what to think about happiness. It is there to help us think about it. It is, we might say, a structure to help us think.""Legends thinks very hard about what it means to reinvent one's life and to take unfamiliar risks. It uses an extremely familiar characters--orcs, elves, gnomes, dwarves, and humans--and an equally familiar setting--a generic fantasy world with a touch of 19th century technology. In short, if you've spent an hour playing Dungeons and Dragons or in World of Warcraft, you'll fill in the blanks just fine. In fact, I think you are expected to: Baldree focus most of the narrative on Viv's quest to build her dream coffeehouse. As common as that sounds, coffee is unheard of in this part of the world, so she reaching her goal will require some clever approaches. She's got an ace up her sleeve to help her succeed.'Low-stakes,' I think, mislead my idea of what to expect. For Viv, these are very high stakes: she's walked away from her friends and a lucrative career as a mercenary to settle down in a new city and open the coffeehouse. The events in the story continue to challenge Viv, both emotionally and socially. Her new role as business owner means she can't resort to swinging a sword every time trouble appears.""I’m just saying that … maybe, if you treated the rest of your life the same way you do the shop—invested in it the same way—then the cost would seem less.”Is it then, cosy? Despite the clear roles of a D&D adventuring party, there are no adventures and the solution to the plot will not be slaying the Big Boss. There is a notable absence of horror which, frankly, is a relief, but don't interpret that as a lack of threat, violence, or physical danger. There is pervasive humor, both in a gentle way and in a more ribald fashion, particularly from the old woman living down the street:“I don’t mind tellin’ you, this beats the smell of horse apples, any day of the week.” Her eyes disappeared in the dried-fruit crinkle of her grin. “I’d always hoped we’d clear the high bar set by horseshit.”Should you read this? Maybe. There's perhaps a few flaws. Personally, I'd think it'd be a stronger work if it went through the writing mill one more time, but perhaps someone said, ""hey, this is about an orc. We're not talking Tolstoy, here. No need to get fancy."" But you know, in some ways we are: we're looking at how one person steps out of the system and changes their life. I think it's worth my time re-reading, and I look forward to the next installment Baldree releases.",4

"768","61242426","I suppose it all comes down how much you like cozy books and reading about cozy coffee shops and pastries, and the cozy loveliness of found families. I do find all these lovely, but after a few pages I really really really want more. A book equivalent of a warm hug by a fireplace is not my cup of latte, I suppose. It’s not my croissant. Yeah.I think it’s what I’d call a post-pandemic book. A cozy sort of literature that, despite being billed as “high fantasy and low stakes” really has barely a fantasy gloss and is mostly about those low stakes, about virtually conflict-free feel-good book hug. And I’m too scruffy for that. 
   “After twenty-two years of adventuring, Viv had reached her limit of blood and mud and bullshit. An orc’s life was strength and violence and a sudden, sharp end—but she’d be damned if she’d let hers finish that way. It was time for something new.”
A retired orc mercenary opens a coffee shop. Oh, that’s the idea that can be fun with the right ingredients mixed in. (Damn, these lengthy food descriptions really got into my brain). Just add a little humor or sarcasm or anything, really. But instead it treats its premise with such wide-eyed earnestness that it’s almost painful. I mean, for a bit I was thinking it was cozily overdone on purpose, with subversion right around the corner — but no. It’s earnestly sincere and full of food porn. It’s a barely disguised Starbucks menu (or you can really just insert your preferred coffee joint here, it wouldn’t matter). At 55% we actually discover iced coffee and to-go cups and my eyes have finally terminally glazed over. But it’s me — I find reading about food and drink incredibly boring. Caffeine — I prefer to drink you, not to read you. I’ll just put my own reading status updates here:“40% in and nothing has happened except for a retired orc mercenary setting up a Starbucks in a quasi-medieval city. It's indeed low stakes, huh? Hoping for eventual infusion of a plot other than ""lattes are so cool we don't even have a different fantasy name for them"".Admittedly, lattes ARE awesome...”“55% in and the biggest plot twist is discovery of iced coffee 🤦‍♀️(I’m awaiting the advent of cold brew. Then it’s 5 stars for sure.)”And the earnest moral here is — pursue your dreams, and found family is lovely, and why don’t we all just munch on pastries and drink a latte and listen to live music and life will be good. Which is probably true, but also quite snoozy to read about in a book that can’t disguise itself as a fantasy enough to even rename lattes.But that’s just me and my crusty soul. To those of us with different tastes this will be a lovely read. If you loved Becky Chambers’ The Galaxy, and the Ground Within or T.J. Klune’s The House in the Cerulean Sea, you’ll likely to enjoy this as well as those are soul cousins. They are like lattes from the same coffee shop, one can say.2 stars. Looking forward to a cold brew coffee tomorrow. (To drink, not to read.)——————Also posted on my blog.",2
"769","61242426","If this is the future of fantasy, then count me out. There is just nothing to this story, no imagination, interesting relationships, intriguing themes, etc. The characters all begin and stay one-dimensional, and instead of a fantasy version of a café, we just get a replica of Starbucks or any contemporary café chain with the exact same menus, equipment, social norms, and patterns of café interactions. I want to see more kindness and collaboration in fantasy, but here, we got artificially sweetened wish fulfilment where nothing felt earned.The whole premise is basically that the characters reinvent Starbucks – they ""invent"" takeaway coffee and writing someone's name on the cup, and the idea of having a pastry with coffee, and then invent cinnamon rolls (complete with frosting), biscuits, etc. – instead of actually engaging the imagination of what a fantasy café might be like, what kinds of fantasy ingredients could be available, how they could adapt to having very diverse creatures as guests, how to make it accessible for all kinds of sizes, how to make the best mugs for different kinds of hands/paws, coffees for different dietary restrictions & preferences, etc. etc.Finally, the repetition of the menu in audiobook format drove me insane – we have to hear it recited at least 5 times.In summary: cute premise, but it delivered watery instant coffee instead of a cinnamon latte with cream.",1

There’s not much plot, you are just following our main character along while she tries to put together her own Coffee Shop and makes tons of friends along the way.  No hate towards it, but set your expectations straight.  If you have a 10-14 year old, this would be a great book to gift them.

"773","61242426","I think I now understand what everyone meant when they said this book is cozy and perfect whenever you need a pick me up.Legends & Lattes follows retired orc, Viv, who decides to settle down and open a coffee shop. Readers follow every single step of the process from the creation of new drinks and foods to finding shop entertainment.What Worked: This is definitely what I consider to be an accessible fantasy book for those who don't typically read a lot of fantasy (I'm talking about me!). There isn't necessarily a lot of world building, but readers get the chance to see the charming step by step process that Viv goes through in creating her very own coffee shop while also falling for her unintended business partner that just happens to be a succubus. As they kept recreating the menu and adding different elements to the shop, I couldn't help but smile especially since coffee and some of the snacks they offered weren't well known to their cliental. Another highlight of this book was the character development. There were so many sweet and charming moments (even in the face of conflict) that just made the story even more enjoyable especially that hinting of a sapphic romance. Overall, this was a comfy read. I wouldn't necessarily go in expecting a lot to happen, but if you're truly into reading something for vibes I wouldn't look past this title. I'm looking forward to seeing more in this world in the future.",4

"776","61242426","I absolutely loved this book! This was such a kind and heartwarming cozy fantasy about friendship, family, love, and finding your purpose in life. Legends and Lattes follows Viv, an orc who retires as a bounty hunter and follows her dream of opening her own coffee shop. Along the way she makes friendships that will last a lifetime. I was immersed in this beautiful and cozy world that the author created from the very beginning. I appreciated that this book moved away from intense battles and focused on friendship and the little things in life. I loved the inclusion of fantasy characters including orcs, dwarves, hobs, elves, gnomes and other unique creatures. This book felt like a warm hug. I couldn't stop smiling while reading this book, it was so wholesome. I loved the characters so much! I love Viv, she is strong, kind, hardworking, persistent and caring. I also love Tandri, she is helpful, mysterious, sweet, charming and artistic. I really liked the side-characters especially Cal, Thimble and Pendry. I love Viv and Tandri's relationship, they are so patient and perfect for each other. I will definitely remember this story and the message for a long time.I recommend this book to anyone who loves cozy fantasy, great characters and wholesome vibes.",5

"779","61242426","Extreme cosy fantasy in which a retired orc sets up a coffee shop, gathers a found family around her, and serves lattes and chocolate croissants. That's basically it. I believe the term is 'no plot, all vibes'. It's very likeable. The characters are all very sweet, the mood is charming. There's a huge sense of being yourself, rather than the person the world tells you to be, and a sweet slow burn romance, and a general sense of the world rewarding decency, which is a lovely thing to imagine. I found the fantasy replication of a Starbucks a bit flat, down to the pastries and takeaway cups with your name on them, but I can entirely see how people who want a coffee shop AU would go nuts for this. It's clear why people adore this, and I wholeheartedly love that there's books to scratch that itch. It's not my jam because I like builder's tea and plots, but if you like lattes and vibes you will be in heaven.",NA

"781","61242426","“So. I might not deserve you. And you might forgive too much. But I’m damned glad to have you.”
This is exactly as adorable as everybody said. There is nothing but cuteness from start to finish, and just enough conflict and angst so it doesn't get boring. There isn't much plot, per se, it is heavily focused on Viv's coffee shop. Also, there is almost no romance at all, other than a few long looks, some moments of closeness, and a very brief kiss. All of them are heartwarming. What there is a lot of is the found family trope. It is clear that this book revolves around the wholesome relationships between the characters and what brings them together as much as it is about coffee. This is purely a feel-good book. However, I have one complaint. The beginning of the book is significantly slower in pace than the rest. There is too much focus on the building process of the coffee show. While I understand its significance as it comes back later, I think that fifty pages is too much of it. Moreover, the characters are all amazing. Viv is the sweetest orc there is. All she wants is to make people happy with coffee. She has some people from her past she cares for as much as they care for her, and everyone she meets in Thune is adorable. Also, Tandri, Viv's assistant in the coffee shop, is thoughtful and loyal, with a dark past of her own. She is a succubus who just wants to be accepted and respected in spite of her species. Besides, Thimble, the coffee shop's baker, might just be the best character in the book aside from Amity the dire-cat, who is basically just a giant cat. No more information is needed. Thimble is a small-statured, selective mute with insane baking abilities and a kind heart. There's also Calamity, Cal for short, a hob who is as equally shunned as orcs and succubi but hasn't let that affect who he is. He does honest work and is a wonderful friend. Not to mention Pendry, the bard. He is as brave as he is talented. He refuses to let his fears and insecurities win and I love him so much for it. All of Vib's customers are the same as well. In fact. even some of the antagonists are likable. I didn't hate them for long. I would literally die for all of them.Lastly, what I loved most of all is obviously the relationship between the characters. That is the most important part of the book. It is pure and a cure for the soul. Even when misfortune found Viv, everyone stuck with her and helped her, even those who antagonized her. Even though there is little to no romance and I expected some more, I was perfectly content with the platonic love between all these characters. I didn't need anything more.",4
"782","61242426","Okay, I think I see what all the fuss is about.It's cozy, it's quiet. It takes conventional high fantasy tropes and spins them. It has coffee shops and orcs and elves and succubi and bards and direcats and dwarves, and tackles the logistics of living in a magical world where these things exist.And the friendships and forging new paths and second (and sometimes third) chances, while also dealing with the frustrations of the past.It was good and cute, but despite the way Baldree so aptly played with all of these elements, I felt like I was following along to a really cute and cozy D&D session. Which isn't bad, but I kinda wanted...more? But that is because this book has been SO hyped.Edit (Nov 2023): Also--and this has been bothering me for literally an entire year, but the way Baldree wrote this sapphic relationship was very straight white man writing women. An attempt was made. It was a complete miss.",3
"783","6294","Honestly what made me want to read this book was the movie. *gasp* I know, I know shouldn't do that. The movie was good (I am a fan of Hayo Miyazaki's films) and I wasn't disappointed in the book. As always much of the book wasn't put into the movie, but it was understandable because I imagine it would be hard to piece together a movie with all the components this story has.To really grasp and understand the book I would suggest that it be read twice I think. Since I did watch the movie I wasn't as shocked at things, but I was so impressed about how the author intertwined all the strands of the story together. If you have a chance definitely read the book first. The author did an impeccable job of piecing things together to get a wham-bam of an ending.Ok quick summary: Our main character is Sophie. She is the oldest of three girls and works in a hat shop. Things change when the Witch of the Waste (evil bad women) puts a spell on her that makes her old. She meets the infamous wizard Howl (great character) and it takes off from there. Make sure to pay attention to  ALL DETAILS  to get the ending. (Sorry if the review isn't that great. It's the first time I'm trying something like this, so I'll apologize now for all the confusion I may have caused, and the errors in the review.)2024 update: this story holds up so well, years later",5
"784","6294","I read this to my daughter, Celyn (10 at the time), who is too disabled to read books by herself.I had seen some of the anime film version years ago but remembered basically nothing of it.I found the whole thing original and refreshing. The point of view character (Sophie) is engaging and no-nonsense with a very capable can-do attitude. The story moves along at a good pace and the whole moving castle / multiple doors thing is a great idea and used well.The Welsh connection is well-played, and the continuing reveals keep everything interesting.My only complaint is that the end seemed rather tortured with so many story-lines converging in ways that felt rather unsatisfying / hard to believe. The  Miss Angorian  part, for example, seemed to come out of left-field and made very little sense to me.If I were a touch harsher then that ending would pull this down to a 4*. But Celyn loved it. I enjoyed reading it. And I'm in a good mood. So 5*!I can see why it's a classic, and if you have a 10 year old, point them at it! We may well pursue the author's other works.Edit: We've now finished the trilogy!Join my PatreonJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...",5
"785","6294","Buddy reading this with Howl's Moving Castle fans helped me get more pumped up for the story. I enjoyed the whimsical atmosphere, the simple charm of the protagonist, and the quirkiness of Howl. As I got to the second half of the book though, it was hard to maintain interest due to not much happening. I think if it weren’t for me projecting the Miyazaki characters onto the text, I’m not sure if I would enjoy the book as much by itself. That being said, if there were more romance, I would have been more shamelessly into this regardless of plot!",3
"786","6294","I came in expecting a novelization of the movie (one of my favorites), but what I got was even better. Good news: The atmosphere and characterization is extremely similar to the Studio Ghibli film. I absolutely loved practical, stubborn Sophie and vain, dramatic Howl as well as the overall concept of the story. Those were the reasons I wanted to read the book in the first place, and luckily it delivered.The book is simply more. We get more insight into Sophie and Howl's backstories and strong personalities, more time in different worlds, more characters, more factors working against our protagonists, and more explanation of how magic works in this universe. As someone who loves to completely understand fantasy worlds and how they work, I loved it. Since there were so many factors introduced throughout this novel, the ending felt a little rushed. I loved it just the same!The movie is a great movie, and the book was a great book. They are two very different experiences, but work perfectly hand-in-hand. I would recommend it to all fans of the movie and YA fantasy!",5
"787","6294","There is, of course, a wonderful anime about this book, with the same title. But as is true of many, many books and movies, I found the experience of reading to be very different from that of viewing.In my opinion, any movie based on a book is really a movie about one reader's reaction and interpretation of a book. In this case, it's an enjoyable one, but I felt that it missed many of the nuances of the story that made it such a great read. I've yet to read a book by Diana Wynne Jones that did not enchant me. But among her books, this one is special to me. Every character is engaging. The world and situation is unique. There is a thoughtful thread that runs through the story about how we see ourselves and how we see others. Appearances can be deceiving, and not just to people outside ourselves.There are magics here that are both gentle and profound. Definitely a book that can be enjoyed more than once.",5
"788","6294","‘Doors are very powerful things. Things are different on either side of them.’If the whimsy for a magical adventure oozing with charm and full of unforgettable characters ever strikes you, might I direct your attention to the Diana Wynne Jones’ endlessly entertaining Howl’s Moving Castle. It is a story where assumptions are tested and often overturned and the characters are full of as much nuance as they are personality, making for an engaging read that will keep you on your toes. Sure, there is the Miyazaki film adaptation, but the two are different enough to each stand on their own and this novel is such an fun-filled event I stayed up far too late to finish the book but do not regret yawning my way through the following workday. Howl’s Moving Castle is a quirkily endearing coming-of-age story in a fanciful realm of magic and mystery that explores ideas of freedom, family and that appearances can be deceiving.
  The film adaptation of Howl’s Moving Castle by Studio GhibliWhat really sticks this story straight into the readers heart are the characters that populate the magical realm of Ingary. Jones creates a world that is adjacent to our own, with characters such as Howl’s sister Megan still residing there (her frustration with her brother often hinging on not knowing he is in fact a magic user in Ingary instead of pursuing a job). The story follows Sophie, the oldest of three sisters and ‘it is quite a misfortune to be born the eldest of the three. Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst.’ A run-in with the Witch of the Waste leaves her cursed to have the body of a frail, elderly woman, but Sophie is a fiery and determined woman who seeks an end of her curse and forces herself into the employment of Howl, a wizard with a dangerous reputation who roams the countryside in…you guessed it, a giant moving castle.'My shining dishonesty will be the salvation of me.'Howl is an absolute delight as a character, and also rather insufferable (which is half the fun). Appearing at first to be a villain, the more we learn about Howl the more endearing and completely aggravating he is. To the reader and especially Sophie. Prone to tantrums (he trashes the castle over a bad hair dyeing), being overdramatic (‘I'm going to bed, where I may die,’ he says of a minor cold), and reckless womanizing that leaves behind a string of broken hearts, Howl is ‘fickle, careless, selfish, and hysterical,’ says Sophie. He is a ‘slitherer-outer,’ with his cowardly side keeping him from action, yet there is another side of him that makes him shockingly likable. Jones jokes in interviews that when girls say they are in love with Howl she says to not do that as he is awful, joking that in response to them saying they would like to marry Howl she says 'Howl would be one of the most dreadful husbands one could possibly imagine.' But his duality gives him charm and a weight as a character that is rather infectious, and, yo, this dude is supposed to be HOT so I get it.’Half the time I think he doesn’t care what happens to anyone as long as he’s all right— but then I find out how awfully kind he’s been to someone. Then I think he’s kind just when it suits him—only then I find out he undercharges poor people.’Howl is a perfect representation of how appearances can often be deceiving in this novel, and Jones writes really excellent gray characters that were fairly nontypical for the children’s fantasy novel genre in 1986 when it was released, which is part (along with the great humor for sure) of what makes this just as engaging for an adult to read. Sophie looks old and frail, but is determined, the fire demon Calcifer looks ‘extraordinarily evil’ but he is an anxious and charming, even the castle seems like a massive evil building but is actually just Howl’s home bewitched to be able to move about without ever actually leaving. This latter example plays into another theme where the character’s homes tend to represent them, Howl’s being a wandering sort that is actually all just smoke and mirrors or the Witch living in the middle of nowhere as a representation for her isolation from everyone.‘A heart's a heavy burden.’Every character seems simple but are always hiding a tangled web of motivations beneath the surface. Howl and the Witch also tend to take advantage of their appearances in order to get what they want. This contrasts well with Sophie, who is prone to brash action without thinking. The catch in the book, however, is that one’s identity often becomes a sort of imprisonment to them. Destructive patterns get them into trouble, Howl’s good looks play havoc on his relationships and Sophie’s lack of self-esteem is a major obstacle for her to overcome throughout the course of the book. This also plays into overcoming expectations, such as the curse placed on Howl using a John Donne poem about impossible tasks. The ultimate task, to find a 'woman true and fair,' does smack of some misogyny that Jones delights in overturning, but overturning and subversion is the name of the game here. This is a world where nothing is impossible, and if we let ourselves be stopped simply by expectations, what are we missing in life? In what ways are we self-sabatoging?It is impossible to not think of the Miyazaki version of this book when, to be fair, it is what lead me to reading Jones’ original. Being loosely based on the book and taking it in different directions, I feel the two are easily enjoyed separate from each other and I never feel compelled to “prefer” one or the other. I do enjoy how the movie takes a much greater anti-war stance, something that Miyazaki often features in his film and is vocally anti-war in his personal life. He did not attend the Academy Awards when his film Spirited Away won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature and told the LA Times ‘The reason I wasn’t here for the Academy Award was because I didn’t want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq.’ Diana Wynne Jones enjoyed the film, saying ‘I was thrown back in my seat with amazement’ (there is a good interview of her talking about the film you can watch here), and had made special requests of Miyazaki to not change anything of Howl’s personality. Howl’s love of all animals and refusal to kill is emphasized well as a theme of pacifism in the film.Howl’s Moving Castle is destined to become a classic, and is effortlessly charming and nearly impossible to put down. It is a wonderful statement about moving away from our defensiveness and out of the prisons of the self we either self-impose or have assumed of us based on appearances. This is a story where the only thing to expect is the unexpected and it makes for a fun and often very funny ride. Definitely would recommend.4.5/5‘I think we ought to live happily ever after.’",4
"789","6294","I have to say I love Hayao Miyazaki's movie better because come on, it's an awesome movie. (Although, Spirited Away is my favorite movie) There were some differences in the book but the movie was based off the book and it's not going to be the same. All that matters is they both were awesome and the author loved the movie too. I absolutely love fantasy worlds that are way out there. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺",5
"790","6294","this is the most magical story I have ever read",5
"791","6294","Lo~ovin' you, is easy 'cause you're beautiful (Loving You – Minnie Riperton).I’ll admit that a lot more decision making went into starting this book than most of the stuff I read. I was doing some serious research, watching the movie, a bunch of “behind-the-scenes” stuff on YouTube, and I even had the soundtrack on repeat for several days. Then I decided… yeah, I should probably read the book. It is the original after all. Though, it’s kind of scary, you know? Reading a book from so long ago. I mean, I’m aware that 1986 isn’t that long ago, but I’ve had bad experiences with reading older fiction before. Dated language, dated sentiments, the usual. But I know this version is rather beloved, so I figured I have to at least give it a fair chance. In fact, I went into this being so sure that something from above would smite me if I hated it, that I was seriously prepared to pretend to love it the same way I did with Lorde’s “Solar Power.” Well, color me surprised at how much I actually liked this. I was blindsided, really. The thing is, this book had an uphill battle from the jump simply because of how fully enticed I was by the movie. And it’s not just the bigger romantic focus and the powerful anti-war message, I think I’m just really easily moved by pretty animation and beautiful music. It’s a hard feeling to capture on a page. Thankfully, after a couple chapters getting used to it, I came to appreciate and really enjoy this book for what it is. It doesn't sound like it, but I swear I did! It was surprisingly easy to fall into step with the narrative and the characters were as charming as their movie counterparts (albeit with a few key differences)! It’s a little funny, because when I was watching the Studio Ghibli version, I found it so abstract that I kind of chalked it up to cultural differences, but after reading the source material it’s like… no, the story is just like that. It’s quirky! Is it obvious that I love, love, love Ghibli movies? Because I really do. I love Studio Ghibli movies! And not just for the aesthetic! Whenever things feel like they’re happening too much, every movie of theirs feels like an exaltation of a breath I didn’t know I was holding.Now that I’ve consumed all available Howl’s Moving Castle media (to the point where I’m probably Howl’s Moving Castle’d out), I think I can safely say that I slightly prefer the movie adaption. Big surprise, I know. I like both, but I think I just like Howl’s portrayal more in the animated adaption. He’s still vain and afraid, but he’s a bit more dashing, a bit more mature, and a bit… more. He doesn’t really undergo too much character development in this book and you could pretty much open it up to any page and he’d be doing the same shtick he’s been doing the entire story. Even after the big “I love you” reveal, he might as well have looked at the camera and said, “Don’t worry guys, I’m the same old Howl!” Sorry, but… maybe I don’t want the same old Howl! I want movie Howl! Ahhh, I know what it is. Book Howl is that one guy. The sitcom husband, the dude who you can tell doesn’t actually want a girlfriend or a partner, not really. At the end of the day, what they really want is a mommy. And while there’s no doubt that the book certainly has more world-building and goes more into the details of the “who-what-when-where and why,” I think that this tale is more than sufficiently told through the movie adaption. To the point where I’d argue that it’s sometimes improved upon. For example, through visual cues, we see how Sophie’s old woman curse seems fluid, constantly changing rapidly throughout the film, implying that it was more of a metaphor for her resignation in life, and we get to see the curse break every time she feels passion and love for Howl, showing that she had the power to break it within herself the whole time. Or how, on the flip-side, after falling in love with Sophie, Howl’s appearance loses its extravagant and flashy nature, showing that he’s more comfortable being “his true self” around Sophie, without all the glam and glamour. I'm more than happy with metaphors, I don't need literal, in-universe, explanations for the these things. Anyway, woah, lots of comparison talk, huh? I feel like I have to keep saying it... but don’t worry, like I said, I liked this book. Quite a bit actually, it's different but still good! Even if I’m more partial to the movie adaption, the book version managed to muster up more than enough magic and whimsy to keep me enraptured.“Don’t you think I did any of me myself, then?” Howl asked. “Put in just a few touches of my own?”“A few, and those not altogether to my liking.”",4
"792","6294","For some reason I've been reading a lot of really great books lately. I feel that itch to find something I can tear apart and relish in the destruction. However, Howl's Moving Castle didn't provide me with that opportunity.It is an amazing and fantastic book. The characters are so very different, funny, quirky and lovable that I was sucked in right away. The storyline was intriguing and fun to read. The writing was quite good and the world was utterly fascinating.If you've watched the movie then you needn't worry about being spoiled of the book or ending. They are actually nothing alike. The movie, whilst I really enjoyed it, to the original premise and basic character traits and made its own story from there.Sophie is hilarious. She almost makes me want to be an old lady, just so I can be cantankerous and boss people around. Howl is funny and sweet as the brilliant yet vain, thoughtless, mysterious wizard. The whole story is great and I highly, highly recommend it.",5
"793","6294","The first time I read this book was on a tiny phone screen in the scattered quiet minutes of a night shifts week. I loved it so much - I thought maybe partially because of sleep deprivation brain fuzziness that can give a good book the shimmer of that happy giddy feeling. But now I reread it with brain well-rested — and the magic still holds. Sophie, the eldest of three sisters and therefore *clearly* doomed to failure, is an old soul. Enough of the old soul that, after unwittingly upsetting the Witch of the Waste, she is perfectly fine unexpectedly finding herself turned into a crone. And then she makes her way to Howl’s Moving Castle, “far too tall for its height and not a very regular shape”, makes a questionable alliance with the trapped fire demon Calcifer (a fallen star) who’s eager to be let out of its contract with Howl, and sensibly gets the place in the order it so desperately needed.
  “Annoyed?” said Sophie. “Why should I be annoyed? Someone only filled the castle with rotten aspic, and deafened everyone in Porthaven, and scared Calcifer to a cinder, and broke a few hundred hearts. Why should that annoy me?”
Sophie is quite mistrustful of her new employer — the wizard Howl (also sometimes known as Howell Jenkins, PhD and supposed good-for-nothing disgrace for the family), the rumored devourer of young girls’ hearts; fickle, vain and mercurial — and kind to those in need of assistance, and prone to overcharging the King for his magic spells while undercharging the commoners. He can be quite exasperating, yes he can.
   “Well, he’s fickle, careless, selfish, and hysterical,” she said. “Half the time I think he doesn’t care what happens to anyone as long as he’s all right— but then I find out how awfully kind he’s been to someone. Then I think he’s kind just when it suits him—only then I find out he undercharges poor people. I don’t know, Your Majesty. He’s a mess.”
 Or maybe it’s just that Sophie tends to judge too quickly sometimes. Maybe there is more to the world than meets the eye. Maybe first impressions are misleading and really getting to know someone allows surprising things to shine through. Maybe there are fallen stars and stolen hearts and traveling scarecrows and cowards that are brave and slither-outers who are honest and seeming shallowness that has new startling depths, and annoyance that grows into affection.Is it a children’s book? I don’t know. It’s simple and sweet and yet can be complex in unexpected ways. It sure spoke to this adult over here. Its humor is kind but at times also a bit quirky. It delightfully turns familiar tropes upside down and makes me happily smile again and again. It makes my inner cynic slink away in shame.I love it.5 (falling) stars.———————Oh yeah, and I must be that one person who never saw that Studio Ghibli film.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",5

"795","6294","Howl's Moving Castle, for whatever reason, totally failed to engage me the first time I read it several years ago, but it worked so much better the second time around. I really felt for Sophie, the main character, who feels so timid, trapped and hopeless that when she's (unfairly) hit with a curse that turns her from a young woman into an old crone, it actually frees her in more ways than one. She leaves her dead-end job in the village and, for lack of a better option, moves herself (without bothering to ask for permission) into the oddly mobile castle of the Wizard Howl, where magic and cobwebs fill the air. Obviously the young wizard needs a housekeeper, after all. The fire demon in the castle's fireplace mysteriously challenges Sophie to break ""the contract"" between himself and Howl, and she hopes that maybe Howl and the demon can help break the curse on her as well.The nature and use of magic in this story were quite creative. As a former English major, I really enjoyed how John Donne's poem ""Song"" (""Go and catch a falling star"") was worked into the story.The plot was occasionally confusing, and I wished some things had been explained a little better. I also thought that the wrap-up at the end was a bit too hasty. But overall it was a charming and fun read, and it gets bonus points for an unusually high degree of originality.Upping my rating from 3 stars to an enthusiastic 4. Original review: On paper I should love this book, but it just didn't grab me when I tried to read it about 10 years ago,* and I ended up skimming half of it. I picked it up again at the library the other day and I'm going to give it one more shot.*I was being kind-hearted when I gave it 3 stars, or was overly swayed by the book's reputation. I would be meaner if I were rating it now, but I'll wait to do that until I've re-read it.",4

"797","6294","I have been wanting to read this book for a long time, so decided it was about time I just jump straight in. My deepest heart's desire was that I'd find the female-equivalent to Terry Pratchett, but sadly that is not the case.It was written so well and Diana has an amazing imagination that makes Neil Gaiman look normal. But sadly the characters were flat and I felt nothing for any of them, though I think Howl was the most wonderfully developed of the lot. They were all a little bit ""I'm only here for this one bit then I'll leave"", which is often the case with background characters but not the main, plot-fuelling ones. And the plot: I did enjoy it to some extent but I got lost a few times and wasn't really sure why certain things were happening. I think she tried to cram in so many wonderful things that often happen in to fantasy books in to just this one that it slightly ripped at the seams.The world was a lovely thing to be introduced to, but I can't get over my disappointment in the castle. No spoilers, but I was expecting a lot more than what I felt we were given, particular since the thing is in the title. It was rather clever, but not what I wanted personally. However, the world still felt quite small despite the various places visited. There didn't seem enough given to link all the places together and they invariably ended up becoming just the one place after a while.Despite not quite enjoying this particular book, I do want to read everything else Diana has written, because you can clearly see her amazing imagination and clever storytelling prowess from this book. I think the fact it was a children's book really let it down.",2

"801","6294","Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones opens in a picturesque little village, in a country and a world where magic—gifts and curses, fairies and witches—are not just real, but taken for granted. The people around them manage to have almost tediously normal lives.Our protagonist, Sophie Hatter, is the eldest of three sisters, so she knows her youngest sister will have luck and adventure while she herself will have a dull and obscure existence, probably as an old maid tending her father’s hat shop. At nineteen, Sophie is clever but painfully shy. On a festival day she dares to leave the hat shop and is pursued by a handsome youth she has never seen before. Irrationally frightened, Sophie flees the young man’s advances, only to irritate a mysterious old woman—and suddenly Sophie herself is transformed into an infirm old hag.Unable to explain her metamorphosis and afraid to approach her family in this altered form, Sophie decides to leave town in pursuit of the one person who can help her: the great wizard Howl, whose moving castle recently appeared as an ominous blot on the horizon. Why ominous? Because Howl is said to kidnap beautiful girls and eat their hearts, or perhaps their souls.No longer young and never (to herself, at least) beautiful, Sophie reasons she has nothing to fear.SettingJones sets the stage early on, as much with her narration as with her description. The narrator is an arch observer in the tradition of Jane Austen and L.M. Montgomery, and the world she describes could be any rural town and surrounding countryside in the eighteenth or nineteenth century—with the small addition of magic.Magic here is a respectable enough line of work, usually, but a powerful witch or wizard is still feared.Propriety is of utmost concern in the land of Ingary. Out-of-towners are not trusted, and the wizard Howl, whom no one in the village of Market Chipping has ever (as far as they know) laid eyes on, is particularly suspicious due to his mode of travel and the scandalous rumors that run before him.Howl’s Castle itself, where most of the book takes place, is a marvel of imagination, but I will say no more. It’s not a plot spoiler per se, but I don’t want to ruin anyone else’s delighted surprise at the thing’s operations and abilities.PlotOnce installed as the moving Castle’s housekeeper, Sophie befriends Calcifer, the fire demon whose energy sustains the building. From Calcifer she gathers hints of a terrible secret about Howl. She spends most of the book trying to piece together the nature of her own curse, and the secret that Calcifer cannot fully reveal.At first Howl, a handsome but rather foppish young man, appears to enjoy a carefree existence of fine clothes, using magic for fun, breaking the heart of every girl he meets, and shirking the responsibilities that come with his accomplished wizard status. He repeatedly clashes with this apparently random old lady who barged into his house demanding a job, but as he gets to know her, he begins to suspect she might not be so random at all…Meanwhile, the King’s younger brother is missing, as is one of Howl’s high-ranking wizard colleagues, and a powerful being from Howl’s past is scheming to destroy him, but if I elaborate on any of this, it will ruin the fun. CharactersIf you were starting to think that all YA heroines are either brassy Amazon warrior princesses or sniveling Bella Swans, allow Sophie Hatter to break you out of your funk.Sophie starts out as a painfully timid girl who wears only plain, grey dresses and rarely ventures outside the family hat shop. She is so convinced of her own plainness that when a handsome stranger approaches her on May Day, she assumes the young man is mocking her and runs away. I think a lot of us can relate to this.As an old lady, Sophie takes about twenty levels in chutzpah. She is assertive, no-nonsense, and occasionally cantankerous, but never truly unkind. She becomes the only being in the universe who can make Howl Pendragon obey.For Howl is a flighty, easily-frightened creature, who has built a fearsome reputation for himself in the hope of avoiding conflict. He is the most accomplished wizard in the land—since Suliman disappeared, at any rate—but he shirks the responsibilities that must inevitably come with that status. He craves love, but flits from one girl to the next with no intention of settling down anytime soon. He is also vain, compulsively dying his hair, only wearing the finest (re: flashiest) clothes, and pitching epic tantrums when his beauty regimen is disturbed (although he might really be upset about something else entirely).But don’t let the temperamental glam rock exterior fool you. Howl is one of the very cleverest—and kindest, and gentlest—men you will ever meet in YA, and a lot of his theatrics are cover for his dastardly, altruistic, foolhardy plans…if you want a book boyfriend, look no further!Then there’s Calcifer—a snide, secretive little lump of talking flame in a fireplace, who has a hilariously close-but-vitriolic friendship with Howl. I can’t say much more about Calcifer without giving the whole thing away. The other characters:•	Lettie, Sophie’s vivacious and magically-gifted sister•	Martha, Sophie’s stepsister•	Fanny, Sophie’s kindly stepmother•	A sentient Scarecrow who follows Sophie around•	An enchanted dog•	Michael, Howl’s fifteen-year-old apprentice•	The King of Ingary•	Mrs. Pentstemmon, the great witch who trained Suliman and Howl•	Megan, Howl’s disapproving sister (who lives in Wales. Howl comes from our world!)•	Neil and Mari, Howl’s nephew and little niece•	Miss Angorian, Neil’s pretty teacher on whom Howl has a crush•	The Witch of the Waste, a sinister and powerful being who makes her home on the edge of IngaryAll the supporting characters are engaging. One gets the impression that they are all fully formed characters, but we don’t see all the facets of their personalities because this isn’t their story. Content AdvisoryViolence here is mild and mostly symbolic. During the final battle with the Witch of the Waste, Howl’s heart is torn from his chest and Sophie, who can “talk life into things”, has to coax it back inside his body, thus bringing him back to life.Howl makes a lot of “conquests” among the local girls, but it is never stated how far he has gotten, if you will, with any of these conquests. Given that Howl is really a nice young man, and that Ingarians are well-brought-up sort of people, he has probably not sullied anyone’s virtue or reputation.Howl goes back to Wales to attend a rugby event, at which he so drunk that he is unable to properly climb into bed upon returning to the Castle.Calcifer is called a fire demon—although nothing about him suggests the diabolical.There is no harsh language.The MovieA lot of people only know about this book because of Hayao Miyazaki’s 2004 anime film adaptation, which was well-received by critics and audiences alike. Before I say anything more, I should note that this is the only anime I have ever watched all the way through. I know nothing about the conventions of the genre.That said, I thought the movie was a beautiful piece of visual art, with stunning panoramic shots (we forget how gorgeous well-done 2-D animation can be), lovely music, and high-quality voice acting.There’s only one problem: it has almost no connection to the book it’s supposedly based on.Granted, there is a shy young hatter named Sophie who is cursed into the form of a crone. There is a dashing young wizard named Howl who lives in a castle that moves. There is a snarky fire demon named Calcifer who keeps the castle moving.And that’s about it.The movie’s characterizations—except Calcifer and Old!Sophie—are far off-base. Young!Sophie is sweet and mild-mannered. Howl has one or two memorable outbursts, but is far more subdued than the drama king of the novel. The Witch of the Waste turns out to be mostly harmless, and Suliman is an older woman—in the book he is a strapping fellow, only a few years older than Howl.Also, movie!Sophie is brunette. She is drawn with long braids and a hat, so maybe they changed her red hair brown so she wouldn’t be mistaken for Anne Shirley, a hugely popular character in Japan. But then the movie keeps Howl’s accidental red hair tantrum, which is meaningless unless Sophie—the shy girl who fled his advances on May Day, and whom he strongly suspects by now is one and the same as his elderly housekeeper—is a redhead.But these are minor quibbles. Miyazaki completely changed the emphasis and conflict of the story. Drawing on the Iraq War, the pacifist Miyazaki extracted a hint from the book (literally one sentence long) about a war between Ingary and a neighboring country and turned it into the main plot. The King wants Howl to fly a bomber or something, but Howl, now transformed from a vain and lazy guy into a noble conscientious objector, would rather turn himself into a man-sized black bird and attack both sides’ fighter planes. (The presence of airplanes in the first place is jarring). Then there’s a subplot about how it gets harder every time for him to turn back from bird to man.I respect Miyazaki’s antiwar beliefs, and of course, as the director of the film, he has the right to take the story in whatever direction he wants. But I personally wish he had expressed them in a different film. Howl’s Moving Castle isn’t about war any more than 
  Mansfield Park
 is about slavery—another case of one sentence of the book devouring the plot of the movie. (The MP movie also had a lot of other problems, but that's a story for another review). War is awful, slavery is evil, and happy romances about shy girls in grey dresses and handsome young men (who may or may not be wizards) should be allowed to remain happy. But that’s my opinion. Yours may be entirely different.ConclusionA treat for everybody ages 10 and up—and younger as a family read-aloud—Howl’s Moving Castle delivers adventure, magic, mystery, romance, and humor in a literate, subtly detailed style. It’s a timeless story that begs to be reread, and will surely join The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, and The Dark is Rising series as classics of the genre.There are two indirect sequels that feature Howl and Sophie, though they focus on new main characters and different settings. The first is Castle in the Air, an Arabian Nights-style adventure that might partly be a stealth parody of Disney’s Aladdin. The second is House of Many Ways, which read like a first draft (albeit an intriguing first draft from a deft and seasoned writer) to me, but a lot of other people enjoyed it.Also recommended:•	The Anne of Green Gables series by L.M. Montgomery—not a fantasy, but Anne and Sophie have much in common•	The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis—a similar mix of fairytale tropes, space/time-bending adventures, and down-to-earth protagonists with a witty narrator•	A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket—also features a witty narrator, a mock nineteenth-century feel, and delightful poetry quoting and literary references•	The Queen’s Thief series by Megan Whalen Turner. Not superficially similar, but Howl and Eugenides are soul brothers. These books are violent and complicated. Teens and up.•	The Crown & Court duology by Sherwood Smith. Also features a courtly, long-haired hero, a redheaded spitfire of a heroine, a touch of earthy magic, and an industrial truckload of snark.•	The Tiffany Aching series by Terry Pratchett. Similar fairytale parody with a spunky heroine and very English sense of humor. These books contain some off-color humor. Teens and up.•	The Bartimaeus Sequence by Jonathan Stroud. A much darker—although similarly humorous—look at a human and magical-being partnership like that of Howl and Calcifer. These books contain both violence and off-color humor, and are also extremely long. Teens and up.•	The Books of Bayern by Shannon Hale. The tone of these books is more serious than HMC, and the plots are more straightforward—but they share strong, feminine heroines and organic magic. These books can get dark. Teens and up.•	The Secret Country trilogy by Pamela Dean. Similar wit, character development, and inter-world travel element.•	The Safe-Keeper’s trilogy by Sharon Shinn. Similar faux-English feel and small-town courtships with a hint of deception and magic. Some mature issues including rape, murder, and various forms of child abuse are referenced, though never seen. Teens and up.•

"802","6294","Ahhhh, the wizard Howl... I mean THE WIZARD HOWL.. Drama Queen of drama queens.This is such a delightful, entertaining, original and imaginative story. I have never read it as a kid, but I just loved it as an adult. I also happened to love Diana Wynne Jones's writing style: simple, powerful & competent, without fuss and there is definitely magic there, even though it not obvious at first sight (just like her heroine, Sophie).“In the land of Ingary where such things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist, it is quite a misfortune to be born the eldest of the three. Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst, if the three of you set out to seek your fortunes.” Sophie Hatter, the heroine of this book, happens to be the eldest of three girls so she does not expect much out of life. She is working with her stepmother in the family hat shop and has no idea of the powerful magic that she possesses, namely, to talk inanimate objects into life or to give them strong magical attributes at least.One day, the Witch of the Waste enters her shop and lays a powerful curse on her turning her into a crone. An extra downside is that she cannot tell anyone about it. Sophie, instead of getting desperate, decides to leave her family behind and finally ends up in the infamous wizard Howl's moving castle as the housekeeper-cum-cleaning-lady despite her misgivings about Howl's character. Once in the castle (the door of which is a portal to 4 different places), she makes a deal with Howl's fire demon, Calcifer: he lifts the curse off her in case she manages to break the magical contract between him and the wizard...I think that Sophie is one of my favourite heroines. She is such a wonderful character: nice, competent and calm, yet she is amazingly strong-minded and courageous. The fact that from a young woman she gets turned into an old woman, does not seem to faze her, on the contrary! The disguise seems to set free the inhibitions she have had and it is wonderful and hilarious to see, how she mercilessly bosses around Howl, his apprentice Michael and even the fire demon. So in a way Howl is right when he says to her: ""You're a dreadfully nosy, horribly bossy, appallingly clean old woman. Control yourself. You're victimizing us all.”And there is -of course- Howl himself. He is the character who would probably drive you mad in real life, but delights your heart & soul in print (or on screen). He is Sophie's opposite: showy, fussy, an unparalleled drama queen who spends hours in the bathroom every day to groom himself for his numerous courtships and shirks his responsibilities (he makes Michael to spread the vicious rumour that he sucks young girls' souls to avoid work & and so that he can go about courting his ever-changing paramours). And when he gets a cold.... :)“I feel ill,” he announced. “I’m going to bed, where I may die.” He tottered piteously to the stairs. “Bury me beside Mrs. Pentstemmon,” he croaked as he went up then to bed.” And just when you think his character cannot get any worse, you realise that behind all those shows and tantrums he cares deeply for Sophie all the time He cures her old-age ailments, also tries to lift off her curse in secret, calls her ""Sophie dear"" and knows her inside out.Their relationship is a bit like that of Beatrice and Benedict from Much Ado About Nothing. The get on each other's nerves, but they keep challenging each other all the time and they seem to enjoy all this immensely. “I think we ought to live happily ever after,"" and she thought he meant it. Sophie knew that living happily ever after with Howl would be a good deal more hair-raising than any storybook made it sound, though she was determined to try. ""It should be hair-raising,"" added Howl. ""And you'll exploit me,"" Sophie said.""And then you'll cut up all my suits to teach me.”[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",5

"806","6294","I am so pleased to say I loved this book!This was exactly what I needed to read right now. My year thus far has been full of more serious books with heavy content, but this was a perfect balance of fantastical and lighthearted.Sophie and her two sisters work in a hat shop with only their stepmother for company since the unfortunate death of their father. Being the eldest of three, she has accepted that she is destined for a life of utter mediocrity. When the infamous Witch of the Waste curses Sophie into the body of an elderly woman, she accidentally finds herself in the middle of an adventure that is anything but mediocre. I just want to say that I do not usually enjoy Middle Grade Fantasy.There is normally an odd quality to the writing style of Middle Grade. It's crammed full of ridiculous scenarios that end up feeling like it's just a competition of who can be the weirdest.I can see why others enjoy this, but it's generally not my style. Especially The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making. I just couldn't get into that book to save my life, so I generally stay away from this genre except on recommendation. 
  BUT THIS!
Cutest. Book. Ever.Sophie is such a delightful character. I loved watching her deal with the craziness in this book! She's clever with a kind heart, and a wonderful role model for children.I also really enjoyed all of the secondary characters in this book, it was totally a cast of kooks. Calcifer and Howl had me laughing out loud, and even little Michael gave me a cackle now and again!In this case, the strange writing really played to the story's advantage. It was just odd enough give me that whimsical, spellbound feeling.I would recommend this for people of all ages! It absolutely meets the goal it sets out to achieve. I am very excited to watch Miyazaki's movie adaption now that I've read the novel.Buddy read this with my girl Celeste!",5
"807","6294","4.5 stars! This was a fun and magical young adult fantasy about family, courage, and learning who you are.

During her journey she learns more about herself and discovers that Howl is a nice person. This book was so good!! The world building was awesome, I loved learning about this unique world of witches, wizards and demons that the author created. I was completely immersed in this intriguing world from the very beginning although the pacing in the middle was a little slow. The plot was so interesting and I loved the funny moments in the book. The characters are so fun and complex. I love Sophie, she is tough, stubborn, nice, brave and helpful. I love Howl, he is funny, charming, sweet and stubborn. I also really like Micheal, he is helpful, dependent, reliable and fun. I also really liked the side characters especially Calcifer and Sophie's sisters Martha and Lettie. The character development was excellent, I loved watching Sophie grow into a strong and brave person. I also loved that she learned more about herself and her worth. I loved the banter between Howl and Sophie. The ending was so good! I'm so glad it ended on a happy note! I recommend this book to anyone who loves young adult fantasy, fun characters and excellent world building.",4
"808","6294","Before Hayao Miyazaki made ""Howl's Moving Castle"" into a feature length animated film in 2006 (2004 if you saw it in Japan), it was a book written by Diana Wynne Jones in 1986. Due to the inherent difficulties of creating an animated film, Miyazaki greatly abridged and adjusted the plot of the novel for his movie. I happened to enjoy both film and novel but after reading the book I realized that the plot is extremely different in the novel--enough that the book and movie become completely different viewing experiences.Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about the movie. On to the discussion of the book:Sophie lives ""in the land of Ingary, where such things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility exist."" In other words, all of the traditional fairy tale stories are real. Not so bad, except that Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three sisters, which everyone knows means Sophie is doomed to failure should she ever set out to seek her fortunes. Sophie is resigned to her fate--living obscurely, and less than successfully, working in the family hat shop. Except that this is not a traditional fairy tale and events soon intervene to set Sophie on a very unexpected course indeed for an eldest daughter.It all starts in the hat shop after some interesting things begin to happen when Sophie talks to the hats she trims. Interesting enough to attract the attention of the dangerous Witch of the Waste. When her encounter with the Witch of the Waste leaves Sophie cursed in the body of an old woman, she has no choice but to go out and seek her fortune in hopes of breaking the curse (even if she is an eldest daughter). Along the way, Sophie comes upon a mysterious moving castle that has taken up in the hill's of Ingary. The castle belongs to Wizard Howl ""who was known to amuse himselv by collection young girls and sucking the souls from them. Or some people said he ate their hearts."" Either way, he was not anyone Sophie expected to ever meet let alone move in with. Until she does. Adventure ensues as Sophie tries to break the curse and help Howl with his own uniquely magical problems.In terms of fantasy novels, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is one of my favorites. The world Jones creates is fully realized without ever getting boring or limiting the reader's imagination. The tone of her narrative is also spot on. Readers of Jane Austen's novels or the ""Sorcery and Cecelia"" series will notice a similar narrative voice. Although this novel is largely timeless, the prose has a charmingly Victorian tone--taking its time to arrive at the action, the better to familiarize readers with the characters involved and show the readers just how fantastic they (and the story) really are.I also adore this story because it is romantic, thrilling, and completely absorbing. Even at 329 pages, the novel is far too short. Happily, Diana Wynne Jones follows up ""Howl's Moving Castle"" with ""Castle in the Air"" (1990) and a brand new book featuring Sophie and Howl (""House of Many Ways"") is due out in May of 2008.You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print",5
"809","6294","Rereading this book was just as wonderful as experiencing it for the first time, if not even more so. While I’ve loved the Miyazaki movie for well over a decade, I only first read this book in 2017, though I dearly wish I had read it sooner. Wynne Jones is an absolute treasure, as I should have known from Neil Gaiman recommending her every chance he gets. Below is the review I wrote in 2017, and I stand by everything I wrote then.I adore middle grade fantasy fiction. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was the first book that ever made me cry, and I still get emotional when I reread it. The Phantom Tollbooth remains one of the funniest, cleverest books I’ve ever read, though I didn’t read it until I was in my twenties. A Wrinkle in Time changed my view of the world and helped me embrace myself for who I was and still am. The Little Prince gave me a lot of deep, philosophical fodder for discussion with my family. And Harry Potter remains one of my favorite series, and shall forever be. Always. Now I have a new book to add to my long list of middle grade favorites. Howl’s Moving Castle is utterly delightful in every way, and I wish I had read it sooner.Sophie Hatter is the oldest of three sisters, which means that she’s not going to amount to much. Striving to be content with her lot in life, Sophie encourages her sisters to find their fortunes and sets out to be the best hatter she can be. But when her hats become too popular, the Witch of the Waste barges into her store and turns poor Sophie’s life completely upside down. But, by the end of the story, Sophie wouldn’t have traded her altered life for anything.The characters in this tiny book are so well developed that they now feel like old friends. Calcifer is the cutest demon in the history of ever, and I couldn’t help but hear Billy Crystal’s voice whenever he spoke. He was grouchy and sarcastic and a much bigger softie than he let on. Michael, the Wizard Howl’s assistant, is a scatterbrained sweetheart. Howl himself is vain and lazy and self-absorbed and more honorable than he wants to be. He is also one of the biggest drama queens I’ve ever come across in any fictional setting. And then there’s Sophie. Sophie, who was dealt a bad hand and managed to win the game anyway. It wasn’t until she was cursed that Sophie grew into the person she always wanted to be, and proved herself to be invaluable to everyone in her life.I just want to say, middle grade books do a much better job with love stories than YA books, in my opinion. The love story here was a slow burn, and both involved parties fought their feelings tooth and nail. But when those feelings were finally admitted and embraced, I melted. Seriously, the feels are real. I will go down with this ship. *end fangirling*The book and movie differed on multiple plot points, which surprised me. However, I now love the book just as much as I love the Miyazaki movie. If you love the book and have never seen the movie, I highly recommend it. If you love the movie, you should read the book. You’ll be in for a treat if you do.",5
"810","6294","Howl's lingers with me because of the humor, because of the perfectly executed twisting plot, because of the snapping dialog. Diana is possibly the best writer of her generation but because she wrote mainly YA in a time before HP she was disregarded. You want to know what I think a book should be like? Read this one.",5
"811","157993","*** For those who somehow have no idea about what happens in The Little Prince or cannot figure it out at a reasonable spot in the book, here is a warning - THERE WILL BE, as much as I hate applying this term to this incredibly famous classic that does not rely on Aha! moments to keep the readers' attention, SPOILERS! ****-----------'You do understand that the Little Prince died?' my mother asked as carefully and gently as only adults who know that loss of innocence can be crushing but is brutally necessary can do.'No, he didn't. He went back to his home planet and that stupid rose. It says so right here,' I replied with the comforting stubbornness of an eight-year-old.Later that night, I quietly reread the book and the sad truth clicked, and so did the belated thought that for all the gentle berating of adults in it, this strange and beautiful book was written by one of them and definitely for them, and not for me, and by luring me in with the beautiful pictures it pushed me just a bit further on the inevitable road to adulthood.Or so I see now.Back then, I decided to read the author's biography instead as a distraction from the thoughts that were trying to be a bit more grown-up than my heart cared for - I was the odd kid of a literature teacher mother, after all - just to learn that just after writing this book, Antoine de Saint Exupery died when flying his plane in a war to liberate his country, killed by adults who played a game of war, too dangerous and cruel. And that finally made me cry. And then I went back to the simple security of childhood.
  Then I grew up, inevitably, like most of us do. I learned to do my fair share of 'matters of consequence'. I learned the painful understanding of why certain vain but naive roses can hold such sad power over our hearts. I learned the comfort and longing of nostalgia, the fear of the crushing burden of loneliness, the understanding of fragile beauty of the world that can be so easily taken away at any moment. I became a grown-up, and I have to learn to reconcile my inner child with my outer age.
  ""In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.""
Now, reading this intensely lyrical and mesmerizing book written by an ailing middle-aged adult far away from the country he loved in the middle of war-torn years, I am confronted with emotions that ruthlessly hurt, hidden in the deceiving simplicity of a (supposedly) children's story just like an elephant was hidden inside a boa constrictor - or was it simply a hat all along? - in the opening paragraphs of this book. I sigh and tear up, and try to resist the urge to pick up the golden-haired child that never stopped until he got answers to his questions and carry him away into safety. But I can't. Because if I do so, there will never be 500 billion bells in the stars, and we will never wonder whether the rose is still alive - and it needs to be, because we are responsible for those we have tamed.
  ""But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed.""
This is not a book for children. It's for adults who remember being children and feel nostalgia for the simple comfort of childhood innocence but know they can never go back to it. Because they have met their Roses, and Foxes, and drank from a well with a rusty handle in the desert, and learned that a few thorns may not stand against the claws of a tiger. Unlike the Little Prince, they can no longer go back - but they can look at the night starry sky and laugh, and imagine that they hear an answering clear laughter.
  ""In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.""'What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well.'

"812","157993","The Little Prince is a short story of a man who crash lands his plane in a remote part of the desert. The man meets a little fellow, The Little Prince, who regales him with his tales of his travels around the universe.This was a short book that carried a big punch. Although it is often labeled as a children’s story, it is so full of beautiful symbolism. The Little Prince is worth reading once a year.My favorite tale from The Little Prince’s travel is the story of the businessman. The businessman is busy counting the stars, claiming to own them because he first discovered them. The Little Prince asks him what he does with the stars, and the businessman says nothing. “I own a flower myself,” he (The Little Prince) continued, “which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I rake out every week. I even rake out the extinct one. You never know. So it’s of some use to my volcanoes, and it’s useful to my flower, that I own them. But you’re not useful to the stars.” There was another quote that I just loved: “I need to put up with two or three caterpillars if I want to get to know the butterflies.”This book is part of the 100 Books To Read According to the BBC:https://www.listchallenges.com/bbcs-t...2025 Reading ScheduleJan	A Town Like AliceFeb	BirdsongMar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr	War and PeaceMay	The Woman in WhiteJun	AtonementJul	The Shadow of the WindAug	Jude the ObscureSep	UlyssesOct	Vanity FairNov	A Fine BalanceDec	GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango",5

""I am very busy. Wait. In Twilight, what color was Edward's car?""""I don't know,"" said the Little Prince. ""I have never read this book Twilight.""""I think it was blue,"" said the man. ""Damn!

""In Twilight, what color was Edward's car?""""I believe you said silver?"" answered the Little Prince politely.""Thank you,"" muttered the man. ""Yes! You were right. I should have known that.""""I'm sorry, I must be going,"" said the Little Prince. And he went on his way, thinking that grown-ups were very, very, very strange.",5
"814","157993","Great observations, but personally I think it's overrated. It practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't ""get it"" it's your own fault because you're a ""grown up, and only kids can see what matters."" It's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. It's not wrong by any means, but it's kind of pseudo-intellectualist.I'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because it's more fun that way: A man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him.Ready for the moral? It's really simple: ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."" Or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is.That's a nice philosophy, I get it. I even agree with it one hundred percent. I just think these metaphors are painfully clumsy.",2

It is possible to shed a few appreciative tears on every page of this book if you entertain the thought that the pilot IS The Little Prince. Maybe you won't think that--maybe you'll have your own take on the book---that's the magic about it. This book is translated to English from French. If you understand and/or appreciate French, the deliciousness of that fact can affect you in addition to the sweet storyline itself. The book won't even take you a whole day to read.

(no one can say i don’t give, guys.)first, it’s unbelievably short. if you need more than one sitting to read this book, Something Is Wrong. or perhaps you are reading it aloud to a newborn who cries a lot, or a very poorly behaved adult, in which case I suppose it’s understandable.no excuse for children. they should be enchanted from the get-go.the language is also unbelievably lovely. it’s also incredibly profound. there are countless morals and metaphors and meanings to this book (check out that alliteration). i catch something new with each read. there’s so much imagination appreciation in this book. also star and flower appreciation, and those are two of the things that make life the most worth living. and books of course. and this book IS a book! three for three! (it misses on another reason to live, which is sweets, but you can’t win them all.)the author’s name is Antoine de Saint Exupéry, which is one of the cooler names I’ve ever heard. when de Saint Exupéry wrote this, he was a sad and lonely frenchman in new york, with a vain and beautiful wife whom he loved very much. a lot of really deft analysis of the human experience, including some truly hot takes on american city types. (it’s better than I’m making it sound.)most importantly, THIS BOOK IS TOTALLY ALL TRUE. 100% nonfiction, baby.the narrator of this book is a pilot who crash-lands in the desert, where he meets the little prince. Antoine de Saint Exupéry was presumed dead after his plane (and he) went missing over the ocean. the plane was found, BUT HIS BODY NEVER WAS. the obvious conclusion is that he’s in the stars with the little prince.bottom line: children's classics supremacy.",5

It subjectively depends on what one´s ideology is to imagine what the different characters and actions could mean. Because besides the Obvious criticism of the destruction of childhood imagination and creativity by indoctrination and conformityOne could put on a political, sociological, economic, ethical, psychological, etc hat and start guessing what snake, prince, pilot, child pilot flashback, different humans, the asteroid, etc. mean. Not just Saint Exupery delivered different options when talking about his work, but loads of wise people reading and reviewing it too. Many other classics can widely be defined with one interpretationbut that´s definitively not the case here. One is left with a universe of possible ways to expand one´s thoughts, which is also the reason why this concept has been copied so many times in books and graphic novels.

"820","157993","The Little Prince is the one book of my childhood that truly wrecked me. Wrecked me, irrevocably.It is the one story that I swore I'd never read again.I didn't. I hadn't. I never read it to my son, either.Then, last week, my middle child, my oldest daughter, discovered the 2015 film of it, and came to me, sobbing, and said, “Mommy, you've just got to watch this movie. It's so beautiful.”I did. I watched it. It was a good movie, but, as usual, they added parts, they took away parts, they created violence where it wasn't necessary, etc. So, purist that I am, I marched into the library, checked out the book and told my girls, “If you're going to know a story, then learn the original version.”My hands were shaking this weekend, as I cracked the cover to read it, and the first thing I did was read the backflap, where I was reminded that the author himself went missing a year after the book was published in 1943. I immediately pictured Antoine De Saint-Exupery in his little airplane, crashing somewhere, alone, in the Mediterranean Sea. Pretty disturbing, if you know the premise of this fictional story. The tears started early.I don't know what it is about these desert stories, but they wreck me, every time. I have never cried harder than after watching Ralph Fiennes in that red airplane, flying over the desert in The English Patient, or after meeting Claudia, in Moon Tiger, and realizing what she has lost, what she will never find again, in those desert sands.The desert seems to magnify desolation, naturally, by its isolation. It can be a setting for great reflection, great stories, and even greater loss. And, it is here in this desert setting that our crashed pilot meets the little prince, whose life experiences illuminate almost every important lesson we could learn in a lifetime.Of course I was crying again, but in a good way. I could just sit here, adding quote after quote from this book on this review. I could advise all men that everything they need to know about women is available to them in the passages between the little prince and the rose. I could advise all parents of young children that this is one of those rare books that reminds you how precious and fleeting your time is with your kids.But, “language is the source of misunderstandings,” and I'd be better served to invite you to crash in the desert yourself.

"822","157993","A ""Daddy/Daughter nighttime reading hour"" reviewThis was a toughy for me to review. I wasn't sure of the best perspective from which to provide comments so as to be of assistance to my fellow readers since this is a children's book (rather than YA which would be reviewed purely on its own merits). After a short session of ""what should I do,"" I bravely decided to punt, figuring that there are already more than enough excellent reviews of this without my clogging up the cyber arteries with another one. Therefore, I decided simply to share my experience of reading/listening to the book with my daughter along with a couple of thoughts on the concepts discussed in the story and hope that you can take something useful from it. So as part of our nightly routine, my youngest daughter, Sydney, and I have daddy/princess read time. The other night, she and I listened to the audio version of The Little Prince while we read along with a copy of the book. As usual, it was an AMAZING experience. I am convinced that I learn more about the stories we read from her and her reactions to the narrative than she does from me...and I love it. It's only a two hour audio (86 pages) and yet the two of us spent close to 4 hours listening and talking about the various chapters in the story (plus a brief 15 minute break for Mom to give her a bath while Dad helped big sister Kenzie with her math homework). Sydney had all kinds of questions (some just hysterically funny in how much sense they made from a kid-centric view of the world). We would stop the story after each planet or character to talk about what she thought the story meant and what messages the story was trying to deliver. For those of you with children, you know how wonderful this can be and I was on the ninth cloud watching my little girl ponder over the book. From this perspective, the story was perfect and deserves an easy 5 stars. However, since it's not very helpful to rate a book based on that kind of non-transferable experience, I didn't want to rely solely on that for its final rating. After explaining to Syd the goodreads star system, she would give this 4 stars as she really liked the British accent of the narrator and the crazy adventures the Prince experiences on the various planets. BTW, from Sydney's point of view, 4 stars is the absolute ceiling for any book dealing with ickies like boys and this would easily earn 5 stars had the story been called the ""The Little Princess."" Princes are still second class citizens at this stage in her life...and Dad is oh, oh, OH so perfectly fine with that).For me, looking at this sans Sydney, I liked it but was not smitten with it enough to go higher than 3 stars. The story is well written and has something to say about the human condition and how people spend too much of their lives focusing on the wrong things and not enough time enjoying where they are. A nice message and one I was happy to expose Sydney to, but I was not always enamored with the path the author took to get there. Overall, a good read on its own and a potentially a great experience if shared with your children...as most things in life are. 3.5 stars.",3
"823","157993","“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”I remember, when I was little, I had this round CD case and it contained an audiobook. Now as a child I loved audiobooks, or someone reading stories to me. Still do today, actually. Anyway, the audiobook was titled The Little Prince, and I listened to it quite often. That, however, was at least 10 years ago, possibly more. So I decided that it was time for a reread. (I'm sorry to say that I cannot find the CD anywhere. Maybe my mom gave it away.)Rereading this brought up nostalgia and melancholia. This is a very cute, very sad book, and I don't like the ending very much. I don't understand why the Prince couldn't just fly back to his planet. You know, instead of dying. Or did he die? Didn't he? I think he just left his body behind and returned anyway. But still...why make it so sad when it was already sad enough?This is a beautiful tale of childhood, love and friendship.

"825","157993","[Original review, Jul 24 2018]This month, three plotlines in my life collided. I know Swedish and Norwegian well, and I'd thought vaguely from time to time that I'd like to learn Icelandic too; I've always been a great admirer of Tolkien, and I knew he had been interested in Icelandic; and I have a couple of Icelandic friends. But none of this had ever come to anything. Last week, however, Jupiter aligned with Mars and I entered the Age of Aquarius. I'd just finished reading 
  Tolkien: Maker of Middle-Earth
, which has many striking passages in Icelandic, Old Norse and Old English, and our friend K happened to be on Iceland. Fired with enthusiasm by Tolkien's love of these obscure but wonderfully poetic languages, I asked K if she could possibly get me one or two Icelandic children's books. I just don't know how to thank her: she turned up with not one or two but half a dozen books, including my favorite, Le petit prince. I spent the next few days carrying it with me everywhere, snatching all opportunities to try to make sense out of it.For people who don't know anything about Icelandic, it has the same ancestor as Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. A thousand years ago they were the same language. But the mainland languages have evolved at a normal rate, while Icelandic, on its faraway island, has changed relatively little; so if you speak Swedish or Norwegian, it's like trying to read a language which for an English-speaker would be somewhere between Chaucer and Beowulf. You recognise a few of the words at once, others are more or less mangled, and still others are completely unfamiliar. The first impression is that it makes no sense at all. But I know Le petit prince, and I started trying to guess what word was what, just reading without looking anything up.It was amazing to see how well this worked. For example, let me show you the following sentence:Þar sem ég hafði adrei teiknað kind dró ég upp fyrir hann aðra af þeim tveimur myndum sem ég var fær að gera: myndina af kyrkislöngunni utanverði.The first time I saw this, there were only a couple of words I felt at all sure about. Upp and var must be the same words as in Swedish (""up"" and ""was""). I soon figured out that ég was ""I"" (it is the same word in some Norwegian dialects), að was att (""that""), and hann was han (""he/him""). The words mynd and kind weren't like anything I recognised, but they were common, and having already come across them I realised they must be ""drawing"" and ""sheep"". As I read the book for the second time, the other words gradually fell into place too, and after a while I could read it as sort-of-Swedish:Då som jag hadde aldrig tecknad får drog jag upp för honom den-andra av dem två teckningarna som jag var för att göra: teckningen av pytonormen utifrån.which I might render into sort-of-English as:Then as I had never drawn sheep pulled I up for him the-second of the two drawings which I was able-to make: the-drawing of the-python from-outside.I recalled that there was a sentence something like this near the beginning of the story: it all made sense.How does it work? I've been reading deep learning theory, and it's tempting to conceptualise it in terms of strengthening of neural pathways. I see a word I don't know, and I think of some words it could be: aðra to a Swedish-speaker first looks like ådra, ""vein"", and you only later think of andra, ""second"". This word occurs quite often. ""Vein"" never makes any sense, but ""second"" often makes good sense. So the pathway for ådra never gets strengthened but the one for andra does, and after a while my eyes just start seeing it as andra. The same thing happened with numerous other words. As I'm sure many language geeks will attest, it is such a weird and interesting feeling to find the sense emerging from words which initially looked like gibberish! I'm sorry if I've gone into too much detail here, but I wanted to explain what I mean when I say it's like doing drugs. You actually feel the text changing your state of consciousness.Well, I'm hooked. Though so far, I've just barely started: the grammar is still a mystery to me. All the same, on my latest read-through I notice that the endings of nouns and verbs, which are first looked quite random, now seem to be displaying some recurrent patterns..._________________________[Update, Aug 6 2018]I have been making efforts to understand in more quantitative terms what I've been doing here. First, I thought it would be a good exercise to try copying out the text of Litli prinsinn: this would force me to look carefully at every letter, and also give me a machine-readable version that I could analyse. I'm now about three-quarters of the way through (he has just said goodbye to the fox). I tried running my incomplete corpus, which contains about ten thousand words, through a script that Not and I developed last year.The script is simple but quite useful. It counts frequencies for all the words in the corpus, then builds a hyperlinked concordance which shows me up to ten examples for each word. Every word is clickable, so I can take a word I'm unsure of in a sentence and see examples of that word in other contexts. There is a master index which lists all the words in descending frequency order. Here are the first 50 lines. The 'Freq' column gives the number of times the word occurs, and the 'Cumul' column gives the cumulative frequency:All of these 50 words (to be exact, some of them are punctuation marks) are now very familiar to me, and as you can see they make up more than 50% of the text. I tried walking down the list to see when I stopped feeling confident. I can go as far as words with four or five occurrences, and I think I know what nearly all of them mean; that brings me up to about 400 words, and 75% of the total. When I look at words occurring two or three times, I start to feel uncertain, but I still think I know the majority of them. That gets me to 900 words and 86%. The 1600 words which only occur once are of course the hardest; but even here I feel I can guess a lot, perhaps a third to a half of them.Copying out the text has sharpened my understanding of the grammar a good deal, and now I recognise quite a few endings. Though I'm still pretty hazy about the nouns. With multiple genders, multiple cases and marking for definiteness, there are many combinations, and I only know the most common ones. It's surprising that one can extract so much information from a tiny sample of just ten thousand words. I'll see if I have the patience to finish this and then do Ævintýri Lísu í Undralandi as well...___________________________________[Update, Aug 8 2018]I have finished copying out the text of Litli prins; the file now contains about 14,200 words and about 3,050 unique words. I made a small improvement to our script, so that it now creates an alphabetical index as well. This is very useful for finding copying errors: if I see two words close together which are almost the same, that often means that one of them is an error. Tidying up my copied text is not as tedious as I thought it would be. It's forcing me to look very carefully at everything and consolidate my extremely sketchy vocabulary.I am sure there are still many errors left, but after this initial cleaning up pass I can look at my alphabetical index and get further on trying to understand the grammar. Here's a section showing forms of the word stjarna, ""star"", which occurs often in Litli prins.Some of these are compound nouns: for example, stjörnufræðingur, literally ""star-ologist"" is ""astronomer"", and stjarnfræðiþingi, ""star-ology-thing"" is ""astronomical congress"". But what are all the others, most of which look like inflected forms? I can click on any of them and get a hyperlinked page of examples. For example, let's look at the page for stjörnu, which occurs 15 times:I see that occurrences of stjörnu usually come after a preposition. For example, we have Hann hefir aldrei horft á stjörnu, ""He has never looked at stjörnu"", or En þú ert hreinn og þú kemur frá stjörnu, ""But you are pure and you come from stjörnu"". Most of the others are similar. Hm, looks like this is a dative singular? My suspicions are reinforced by the fact that Swedish used to have a dative; it disappeared long ago, but still survives in a couple of fixed expressions like till salu, ""for sale"", which has this -u ending. Still a great deal more grammar to figure out! There are some improvements to the script that I hope to add soon, and which might help...___________________________________[Update, Aug 12 2018]I have added another little improvement to our script. It now creates a hyperlinked version of the original text, with the words colour-marked to show how frequently they occurred in the text you've read so far. The initial version uses four colours. Words are in black if they occur more than five times, blue if they occur four or five times, green if they occur two or three times, and red if they occur once. Here's an example, the start of the visit to the Drunkard:The colours let you see at a glance approximately how well I now understand the text. Look at the first paragraph:Á þriðja hnettinum bjó drykkjumaður. Heimsóknin þangað var mjög stutt, en hún fyllti litla prinsinn miklu þunglyndi.(At the-third planet lived drunkard. The-visit there was very ?short, but it filled the-little prince much ?depression)Black words like hnettinum (""planet"", I think in the dative) and mjög (""very"") are quite familiar, and I am reasonably confident that I've guessed the green and blue ones correctly. Only two words, stutt (""short""?) and þunglyndi (""depression""?) are in red, and these are indeed the ones I feel least certain about. I'm pretty much guessing stutt from context. I'm more confident about þunglyndi, since I know from other examples that þung, cognate to Swedish tung, is ""heavy"", lyndi is probably something related to Swedish lynne, ""spirit"", and there is a Swedish word tungsint, ""heavy-spirited/depressed"".This was an easier passage than average, and usually there is more red. But it feels motivating to think that, as I copy out more text and process it through the script, the red tide should start to recede...[To Ævintýri Lísu í Undralandi ]",5
"826","157993","2 StarsI know this is a much loved children's classic that has been published in pretty much every language there is. As such, I'm not pretentious enough to think my thoughts on it matter, so I'll keep this short. I have challenged myself to read one classic a month this year, and so far, I am failing miserably. MISERABLY, you guys. It's July (almost August, but I'm throwing myself a bone so I feel like less of a loser) and I have only read two. This one and Peter Pan (of which I also completely missed the plot). And yes, I chose both of them because they are short. And geared for children. So I figured they would be easy to read. Wrong. I finished Alice in Wonderland on December 28th of 2017 (which I ALSO didn't love), after reading it over the course of almost a full month. If only I had really let my loser truly shine and work for me for once and waited three more days to finish it. Then I would at least be three for seven. But I digress. I'm starting to think children's classics might not be for me. At least not these whimsical, nonsensical, fable/allegory-style classics for which I am obviously too uncouth and unintelligent. Or whatever the case may be. Regardless, I am just finding them to be very boring and I just can't get into them. I'm gonna try Dorian Gray next though. NOT a children's classic. So hopefully I have more luck. Fingers crossed.",2
"827","157993","This is my seventh time to reread and enjoy the little prince’s thought provoking, sad, poetic, nostalgic, powerful, emotional journey to the world! Nearly 80 years later from its first release it still addresses to your heart, giving its important social criticism messages and also it gives you hope about friendship, childhood, life. That’s why after all these years the book is still cherished by both adults and young generations. It was also great reflection of France’s fall at the end of World War II. It’s time to build a new country that is rising from its ashes. Anytime I join this adventure, it makes you cry and smile at the same time which makes this book unique, timeless, lyrical, extraordinary. Here are my favorite quotes:“And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”“The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.”“Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them”“Where are the people?” resumed the little prince at last. “It’s a little lonely in the desert…” “It is lonely when you’re among people, too,” said the snake.”“If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...”",5

  WHEN A ROSE IS NOT A ROSE

  It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
I plan to read The Little Prince since many time ago, and I was aware that it was a quick reading, but still I hadn’t do it yet, until now.I went to the cinema theaters and I watched the new animated film about it, and while I hadn’t read the book, I watched the film and I loved it. I was aware that it wasn’t an exact adaptation per se, and then I knew that it was about time to read the book. It was a quick reading, it took me like a couple of hours. Wonderful book.The Little Prince is a metaphorical and surrealist journey where a rose isn’t necessarily a rose, a fox isn’t always a fox, a small planet isn’t a small planet all the time...All those things and more that you can find in the book, they will be whatever you need to be. You just need to recognize what will be the rose, what will be the fox, what will be the small planet...And then, and only then you will be able to realice the power behind of this cute little book.
  HIDDEN THINGS

  What makes the desert beautiful,... ...,is that somewhere it hides a well...
Also, a hidden wonder about this book is that you not only need to realice what things in your own life to interchange with the ones in the Little Prince’s journey, but moreover, you need to “see” with your heart and being able to find the “well” in every “desert”.Sometimes isn’t easy, and I guess that there will be moments when those deserts are truly dry, maybe there was a well some time ago, but it’s long gone. But only you, if you are careful and “observant” with your heart, you will be able to make the difference.At plain sight, your eyes can deceive you about what it’s in front of you, but if you learn to “watch” with your heart, rarely you will be fooled about it.So, not matter if you are in a desert or a little planet (most likely an asteroid), be prepared to take flight and be ready with paper and a pencil, since who knows? Maybe the Little Prince will need you to draw something beyond the evident...",4

However, what separates this from the other two is that this is a book for all ages.There was a magazine called ""Imprint"" (now defunct) during my childhood, in India. It used to publish literary articles and stories. My father got official copies and he brought them home regularly. One issue contained this story, and he gave it to me for reading. I was maybe 10-12 at that time.It left an indelible impression on my mind: I was sad for the little prince and his proud rose, and constantly worried whether the goat would eat it. I chuckled at the silly grownups on the various planets, following their inane pursuits. I was sad when the fox and the prince had to separate, after he had tamed it. And I broke down and cried at the end.I read this book again after a long time... and suddenly realised that I had become one of those adults on the asteroids.

"831","18144590","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate.Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life. The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5
"832","18144590","I need to start this review by stating 1) I can't stand self-help books and 2) I'm a feminist (no, I don't hate men- some men are quite awesome, but I am very conscious of women and our place in the world.)Short summary (mild spoilers): A boy named Santiago follows his 'Personal Legend' in traveling from Spain to the Pyramids in Egypt searching for treasure. Along the way, he learns 'the Language of the World' the 'Soul of the World' and discovers that the 'Soul of God' is 'his own soul.'If the statements in quotes above ('personal legend', etc) fascinate you, then you'll enjoy this book. If you think they are hokey and silly, then you'll think this is a terrible book. If you think statements such as ""When you want something, all the universe conspires you to achieve it"" and ""All things are one"" are moving and life-changing, you'll love this book. If such statements have you rolling your eyes, then this isn't your cup of tea.Its not that I find anything wrong with these messages. They are important, but must be balanced with responsibility. In my experience, 'following your dreams' (or personal legend) is not the only way toward wisdom and strength. Is the person who struggles to put food on the table every day for his or her family, consciously realizing that he or she may not be following his or her 'personal legend' any less heroic than some traveler who leaves everything and everyone he or she is responsible for to go on a spiritual quest? Coelho comes close to labeling such people, as losers in life, which I find completely off the mark as some of these people have the most to offer in terms of wisdom.The issue of responsibility is also part of this book's sexism. The main male characters in the novel have 'Personal Legends' - they are either seeking them, or have achieved them, or have failed to achieve them. But Coelho never mentions 'Personal Legend' with regard to women, other than to say that Fatima, Santiago's fiance, is 'a part of Santiago's Personal Legend."" Thats fine, but what about her own Personal Legend? Instead of traveling to find her dreams, she is content to sit around, do chores, and stare everyday at the desert to wait for his return. This is her 'fate' as a desert women. The fact that women don't have Personal Legends is even more galling considering the fact that according to Coelho, even minerals such as lead and copper have Personal Legends, allowing them to 'evolve' to something better (ie, gold).In the ideal world presented in THE ALCHEMIST, it seems that the job of men is to seek out their personal legends, leaving aside thoughts of family and responsibility, and its the job of women to let them, and pine for their return. Of course, someone has to do the unheroic, inconvenient work of taking care of the children, the animals, the elderly, the ill...If everyone simply goes off on spiritual quests, deciding they have no responsibility other than to seek their Personal Legends, no one would be taking responsibility for the unglamorous work that simply has to take place for the world to run.On the other hand, what if both men and women are allowed to struggle towards their 'Personal Legends,' and help each other as best as they can towards them, but recognize that their responsibilities may force them to defer, compromise, or even 'sacrifice' their dreams? This may seem depressing, but it isn't necessarily. Coelho seems to think that Personal Legends are fixed at childhood (or at birth, or even before) and are not changeable: they have to be followed through to the end, no matter how silly. But in my experience, many people have chosen to adjust, compromise, and even 'give up' on their dreams, only to find that life grants them something better, or they have a new, better dream to follow, a path providing greater wisdom. For me, these people have a more realistic, more humble, more fair, and less cliched vision of the world than Paulo Coelho's vision in THE ALCHEMIST.",2
"833","18144590","***spoilers and bitterness ahead--be forewarned**I'm not sure that I can capture my utter disdain for this book in words, but I'll give it a shot. I read this book about three years ago and just had to re-read it for book club. It was a steaming pile of crap then and, guess what?, it's a steaming pile of crap now. The main reason I hate this book: it's trite inspirational literature dressed up as an adventure quest. You go into it thinking that it's going to be about a boy's quest for treasure. If you read the back, there are words like ""Pyramids,"" ""Gypsy,"" ""alchemist."" Turns out, this is just The Purpose Driven Life dressed up with a little fable. It's Hallmark Hall of Fame territory set in an exotic locale. Which pisses me off to no end as I normally try to dodge that sort of thing, but here it is masquerading as the type of book I normally like. It's cliche, didactic, and poorly written. Just as with Aesop's Fables, there's a moral to the story. And Coelho keeps backing up and running over it just to make sure that we get it (and he capitalizes important key words necessary to understanding it, lest we overlook their significance). If there's one thing Paulo Coelho can do, it's flog a dead horse. Essentially, boy thinks he's happy in life. He's a shepherd who gets to travel the world, has all of his needs met, and owns a book which he can always trade for another book when he goes to market. What more can a boy need? Boy is then told by a mysterious stranger that he's not happy at all. Why not? He has failed to recognize his Personal Legend. Everyone has a Personal Legend, which is life's plan for you. However, most of us give up on our Personal Legend in childhood. If you are fortunate enough to hang onto and pursue your Personal Legend, then The Soul of the World will help you obtain it. All of nature conspires to bring you luck and good fortune so that you can fulfill your destiny, whether it's to be a shepherd on a quest for treasure at the pyramids, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, or, one would assume, a prostitute, drug dealer, or porn star. Hey, we're all fate's bitch in The Alchemist. But I digress. Boy seeks out his Personal Legend and finds it's a long, hard road to obtaining what you want in life. But with faith, perseverance, and just a little goshdarnit good luck, the boy learns to speak the Language of the World and tap into The Soul of the World and fulfills his Personal Legend. And what does he learn? That what he sought was back home, the place he started from. Oh, silly boy. So, in summation, here is what you should learn from The Alchemist:1) Dream. And, while you're at it, dream BIG2) Follow your bliss3) Don't be surprised if you find obstacles in your way, but you will overcome4) It's good to travel and encounter people from other cultures5) What we most often seek is right in front of us, but sometimes we have to leave home to realize itTo all of these important life lessons, I can only say, ""Well, no shit, Sherlock."" If Coelho knew anything about alchemy, he would have been able to transform this crap into gold. Alas, it's still crap. Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder",1
"834","18144590","I really disliked this book. I dislike it in the way that I dislike a great deal of modern self help books. Their basic message is that if you want something to happen, you need to want it as hard as you can, without caring about anything else, not allowing yourself to doubt it, or let criticisms will get in the way then it will happen.I disagree with this notion, not only because it is false, but because it is bad.Just because we desire something, does not make it good. This idea of 'following your heart' is often wrong. Who are we to be the arbiters of truth? Why should our hearts be sources of information that go beyond logic, doubt and reasoning? Haven't we all desired things that have turned out to not be in our best interest, or to be harmful to others? Andrew Jackson was a man known to have a lot of integrity. He was always 'true' to himself and followed his heart. Andrew Jackson is the man who initiated the 'Trail of Tears'. Moving Native Americans from their homes and into reservations. Next, this idea of not letting ourselves doubt or consider doubts. This is a terrible and dishonest way to live. If we don't consider doubts, and entertain them often, then we are deliberately blinding ourselves. Deliberately making ourselves ignorant. If someone doesn't give serious consideration to the idea that they may be wrong. Give serious thought to why they believe what they do, and that perhaps those who doubt them may be correct, then they are behaving in a dangerous and dishonest way.Not giving heed to the concerns doubts and criticisms of others is something I believe is a major fault in modern society. Often, people fail to recognize the needs of the group and the community. We place so much emphasis on the needs and rights of the individual. This causes people to focus so much on themselves to the detriment of others around them. At times, it can be beneficial to go against the group, but one should first give serious consideration to the groups concerns.According to Ideas like the Alchemist, groups like, the Westboro Baptist Church,(godhatesfags.com) should be seen as American heroes. These are people who take a totally irrational stance, and stick to it as hard as they can in complete defiance to the views of everyone around them.",2
"835","18144590","A good parable--like ""The Prodigal Son""--should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. The problem with this little book is that it does precisely the opposite.Coelho's message--and, boy, is this a book with a message--is that each of us has his own Personal Legend, and that if we recognize that legend and pursue it sincerely, everything in the Universe (which is after all made up--wind, stone, trees--of the same stuff we are) will conspire to help us achieve it. Corollaries: 1) people who don't recognize their legends are never happy, 2) people who fail to realize their legends are afraid, and 3) people who refuse to pursue their legends, even when they know what they are, are both unhappy and afraid. (I admit I've left out a nuance or two here and there, but not many. There aren't more than three or four nuances in the book.)I fear that the result of taking such a message seriously will be to make the successful even more self-satisfied, the narcissistic more self-absorbed, and the affluent more self-congratulatory. At the same time, those who are unfortunate will blame themselves for their bad fortune, those who lack self-esteem will lose what little they have, and the poor will see--no, not God, as the beatitude says, but--the poor will see they have only themselves to blame.Perhaps I am being too harsh. I can see how a few individual young persons, hemmed in by parental expectations and seeking their own paths, may find enough hope and courage here to help them venture forth. But I am convinced the damage done by books like this--like The Secret, The Celestine Prophecy, and anything ever written by the late Dr. Wayne Dyer (or, for that matter, anything he may ever choose to channel from beyond the grave)--is far greater than the little good they may achieve.If you like parables, don't read this book. Go read a book of Hasidic tales collected by Martin Buber, a book of Sufi stories collected by Idries Shah, or a book of parables and sayings by Anthony de Mello instead.Or then again, you could just try Jesus. Jesus is always good.",1

The parable-like quality was totally contrived, and I thought the ""moral"" was pretty stupid. Moral: everything you want and need is close to home. Take chances. Follow your ""personal legacy.""Then....there was a supernatural element which was just plain dumb. Granted, I am not religious. I think god-fearing people get more out of this bc they can take that leap of faith, excuse the phrase. If this was supposed to be a story of magic, I may have been into it. But it was supposed to be a simple story of knowing yourself. And I think, philosophically speaking, when you truly know yourself that is when you truly realize your destiny. Why do you need supernatural forces to convey that message? This was about realizing your destiny, or ""personal legacy."" It could have been done without the hocus pocus, and, yes, the cheese. In short, the book attempted to be deep and failed. ""Speaking with the wind and the sun"" and ""being a shepherd"" and getting over ""personal hardship"" all as part of a transparent ""higher plan"" (read: personal legacy) doesn't make a plot deep. A character simply called ""boy"" and short sentences doesn't make a story a fable. Learning from your flocks and from nature doesn't make a character inexplicably wise. I really got nothing out of this book.It is short though. The book came very highly recommended. Read it to judge the hype for yourself.

The basic idea is that if you really want something and ""listen to your heart"", the whole universe will help you achieve it if you only look for omens. A questionable idea in a world where people no longer want to work hard and achieve independently.It reads like a really bad self-help book written for 8 year old children and disguised as a symbolic parable.

It’s epic, uplifting, motivational, inspirational,heartfelt, poignant! Here are my favorite quotes of the book:“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”“The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them.”“Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.”“Don't give in to your fears.

Similarly, the Credence Clearwater Revival song Looking Out My Backdoor, a clunky but loveable country western tune, was actually begun as a facetious parody of slide guitar yokel lyricism. I also think of the comedy / performance art of Andy Kaufman and the constant, uncomfortable tension about what he was doing and why. Was it really so bad it was funny? If it was so obviously corny and insincere, was that not funny? Or was it? Was he really wrestling women and then getting beaten up by Jerry Lawler? That was a joke right?So ...Was Paulo Coelho’s 1988 fantasy / magical realism parable of truths found in nature and subtle messages from God told straight or was there a wink and a nod told with some fun?Now … think about it for a second. The whole “lost gold” theme and the discussions with the alchemist about a supposed elixir of life and “follow your heart” rhetoric. Was Coelho telling this straight or pulling our leg?I have to say that I doubt it, but I did laugh a few times and the over the top syrupy delivery made me wonder, and maybe I liked it better considering this twinkle of a third possibility.I will say that this could go either way. I can absolutely see where someone could find hidden treasure and deeply meaningful messages in the short novel. And I can see someone rolling their eyes and sticking their finger down their throat in a gag gesture.I’ll cast a Cheshire cat smirk and like for another reason.",3
"842","18144590","There are too many things one can learn from “The Alchemist”. Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the “beginners luck” and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives. Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable (i.e. our usual daily life which we get used to) this is actually the time when we are being tested for one last time and it means also that we are really close to our objective. The example given was really great and yes nothing new but we forget simple things in our life like ""the darkest hour of the night is just before the dawn"". It is actually true that so many of us just leave the struggle when it gets really tough and the chips are really low, whereas actually we were so close to the objective, if only we would have had a little more patience we would have been there. In one of the episodes he talks about death, yes the fact we always forget, the only reality about our life, it is a constant which is not going to change rest everything is uncertain. There are a lot of us who either think that it happens to others and then there are others, who are so busy running after the materials that they don’t have time to think about anything, leave alone death. Yes, and those who do think about death, mostly fear it, some fear death because of the physical pain attached to it (such people actually fear the pain rather than the death, I am one of them) and there are some who think they do not want to die because its not time yet for them to go. Ironically but true, this decision about timings has thankfully not been left to us. So, how do we get over the fear of death or make it our friend, a companion? And not waste our beautiful life worrying about dying all the time. One of the possible solutions lies in this book, it reads ""if i have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other"". Yes very much right, one would never know when he or she wakes up in the morning that if it was the last day of his or her life and in fact, that day would not be any different from all the other days already spent. So, why not take everyday as the last day of our lives and live it up. Frankly speaking i really know what i am talking about, because I am in a profession which involves a lot of risk and death doesn’t have to look for reasons, it can just spring up from any bush in form of a small little piece of metal called a bullet coming out of the darkness of the night or just a deafening sound from under a culvert that I cross everyday. Here, everyday can be the last day of my life, every meal can be my last, every call to my wife can be the last time I would hear her sweet and loving voice and the kids… Anyways, so what I personally follow is, everyday when I wake up or every time when I move out on an operation, I say to myself ""what a beautiful day to die"" and there on, I just do what I have to and what I have been taught in all these years in the army and go through all the motions and concentrate on the job at hand rather than worrying about my death and I am really at peace with the fear of death. Another beautiful thought which I came across about death was in the novel by the author called ""Confessions of a pilgrim"". I derived from it that death can be visualized as a beautiful person who is always sitting besides us, so close to us that it travels with us wherever we go and it also accompanies us to our bed. Its a beautiful companion, a faithful companion, the only one who will never be unfaithful to us, rest all the companions are just lesser mortals and have been unfaithful at one point or other. Death always stays with us and actually speaking that’s the only companion who would accompany us all through our lives right from the moment we acquired some shape in our mother’s womb to the moment when we would get the vision of that white light and that feeling of lightness when we would finally leave this body also sometimes expressed as ""VASTRA"" (clothes) in the Indian mythology. As per the Indian mythology, the soul never dies, it is indestructible, it only changes a body just like we change clothes. Our soul is a part of God and it goes back to him. We can find the mention of the mighty soul of ours around the last portion of 'The Alchemist' where the shepherd realizes that ultimately it his own soul which is the “hand that wrote all” and his own soul was the part of soul of God. I firmly believe that there is no fiction involved in this story of the shepherd, but this is a true expression of mysteries and realities of our life, which we never pause to discover. There is message that this book wants to convey to us!!! I have never been into writing anything ever in my life, yes not even a personal dairy, but since the time I actually started writing which was just a month back, I realized that if we just write our thoughts as they occur, the resultant has a touch of mystery, because what we wrote with all our heart and soul, sometimes tends to surprise us. We tend to learn from what we ourselves wrote. We never realized that we had so much inside us and we don’t know from where, it all came. “The hand that wrote all”, yes I think its our soul that speaks out, the soul we never recognized, the one we never knew, the one which is part of soul of God…. …All religions have over all the years have preached a man “Know thyself, you will find God”, “look within yourself u will find all the answers”, these words are so common but how many of us actually are ready to pause and give it a try. It may sound crazy, may be the book has a effect that may appear really crazy but I am sure there are some people who would identify with me. May be when Paulo Coelho wrote this book his soul was revealing itself and that’s why some of us can identify with it because our souls are the part of same soul of God, just like his is. May be these lines of his novel were written by the “Hand that wrote all……………”",5
"843","18144590","All those negative reviews are baffling to me. Where does it say this is a self help book? People are bashing the ""lessons"" as if this is some philosophical or religious work. It's a fictional story that can be enjoyed by yourself or with your kids for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. It's a fun story filled to the brim with quirks and marvels. I was curious the entire time how following one's legend blindly would turn out for the boy. Am I going to now follow my dreams without logic and reason as in the story? No. Because I'm not a crazy person. Get over it. It's just a story and a good one at that.EDIT: My first 100+ likes review. Thank you everyone!",4
"844","18144590","Timing is everything. If I'd read 'The Alchemist' four years ago, I'm sure I would have loved it. It deals in big, bold pronouncements of 'follow your dreams' et cetera et cetera, and it certainly makes you think about your own life and the pursuit of your own ""Personal Legend"" if you will. But maybe I'm older and more cynical now, or maybe it's not cynicism so much as just seeing a reality that isn't so mystical and black and white as Paulo Coelho's, but in any event, I just wasn't buying what 'The Alchemist' was selling.It's a good, quick read, I'll give it that. I enjoyed myself, and I definitely thought a little bit about my own life in the process, which I appreciate from my literature. And while I was more or less with it for a while, I just couldn't stay on board with an ending that left me saying, ""that's it? Really?"" 
  Be forewarned, there will be spoilers after this point
. The whole book Santiago is in pursuit of his ""Personal Legend"", which he is told is a great treasure found in the pyramids of Egypt. Along the way he befriends many people and makes a great sum of money, while also meeting a beautiful young woman who agrees to more or less be his life-partner, Romeo and Juliet-style (which is stupid in and of itself, but more on that later). It is at this point that he determines he has achieved a greater treasure than any he had ever dreamed of, and would go no further. Beautiful. Cue the music and themes of recognizing treasure in all its forms. Santiago has a wonderful, fulfilling life laid out before him, and would most likely die a happy man by the side of his lovely wife and adoring children, all while living comfortably as village counselor of a beautiful desert oasis. Sounds pretty nice, no?Well, that's where the book lost it's footing. Santiago is urged, coerced even, into continuing to follow his ""Personal Legend"", leaving behind his ""love"" (who, it should be mentioned is a ""woman of the desert"" and so is completely fine being abandoned by her ""love"" and will simply wait and wait and wait for him, whether he ever returns or not) traversing the desert and (bizarrely) evading a hostile army along the way by turning himself into the wind (it makes about as much sense as it sounds). In the end though, Coelho reveals to us that Santiago does, indeed, reach his ""Personal Legend"" in a two and a half page epilogue, where it is shoddily revealed that Santiago's long-sought after treasure is...treasure. Literally. Buried treasure. A box in the sand filled with gold coins and diamonds and jewelry and crowns, and all the other cliche treasure images you can think up. What the hell?So what message are we supposed to take from this book then? Money is the most important thing in the world? Women are objects meant to be seen and valued for their beauty, there to serve you and wait around forever while you go on wild goose chases across continents in search of money? Obviously I'm being facetious, and Coelho intended to say that one should follow their dreams no matter what, even if it transcends a nice, content life, so long as you are in pursuit of a life that would be even greater than you can ever imagine, sacrificing what is good now for what can be great later. But he did so in an extremely simplistic way, and the revelation of the Santiago's treasure being literally treasure was a major disappointment.The thing was, despite his simplicity, the book had a nice message going for a while. If Fatima was Santiago's treasure, that I could have gotten behind, even if it shows a good deal of contempt for the role of women in relationships (beauty being the most important factor in deciding on a mate, as Santiago is struck by her beauty and immediately professes his love; Fatima more or less acquiesces immediately and pledges herself to Santiago no matter what, even if he must travel the desert forever in selfish pursuit of his own dreams, with no regard for her), because that is something intangible that is meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of financial standing. But then Coelho basically goes on to say that that is just a roadblock in the way of real achievement, and that one should selfishly pursue their own dreams with no regard for those closest to them.How a book can go on and on talking about seeing the everyday symbols and omens in life and taking heed of them, presumably leaving metaphors for life all along the way, and then have what was presumably the biggest metaphor of them all, Santiago's treasure, turn out not to be a metaphor at all, but just money? To me, that summed up everything. I suppose Coelho realizes this, as he begins the book with a brief fable about Narcissus falling into the river because he loved staring at his reflection, and the river's disappointment in this, as the river loved gazing into Narcissus's eyes and seeing the reflection of itself. This is a horrible little story implying that everyone is obsessed only with themselves, a sad, empty little thought that Coelho spends 167 pages endorsing wholeheartedly, under the guise of following your dreams.I understand that other people love this book and find it inspiring, and I think I would have felt the same way years ago, when I was just out of college and it appeared I had my whole life ahead of me and a lifetime to live it. I'm older now, and I've found someone who I consider to be a real treasure, and while I still have dreams, I'm not willing to sacrifice the happiness that this life brings me every day in a single-minded pursuit of something that I want for selfish reasons (fame, fortune, etc.). If I was Santiago, I would have never left Fatima in the first place if she truly made me happy, as Santiago claimed she did. Perhaps that makes me a coward in Coelho's eyes, not unlike the Crystal merchant from the story. But it'd also make me not the sad Englishman, whose single-minded pursuit of his ""personal legend"" had cost him all his money, friends, and family and left him alone in an oasis burning lead in a tent in the vain hopes it will turn to gold.I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded review, is that this book is all about being selfish and doing what you think will make you happy, regardless of everything else. I can see why that appeals to people, especially those who want to show the doubters and find their own treasure beneath a sycamore tree, but it's sad, in a way. We live in a culture where everyone wants selfish things like fame or money or power, just to satisfy some gaping hole in their own souls, ignoring the real problems that lead to these compulsions in the first place. To me, this book feeds and even encourages that misplaced ideal, and that's a shame.",2

Whoever the ghost writer is for Donald Trump books12. AlchemistJokes aside, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an endlessly quotable book. It reads like a fable, with very catchy and accessible writing that is meant to empower and make you feel good. This really works for a lot of people—I mean this was a widely successful novel—and I’m happy that so many people could be moved and inspired by a book. Especially a book that unites people around the world by being an international success. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it all comes across as a pristine facade without much behind it, offering something that can be quickly digested but isn’t actually filling. This is a book that I recall enjoying enough when I read it as a teen but haven’t thought of since, so when someone picked it as our next read for our book club I was excited to revisit it seeing as I remembered literally nothing about it. I hate to say it, but being fun but forgettable is my takeaway from it again.‘There is only one way to learn... It's through action.’Coelho said the book was written very quickly because ‘the book was already written in my soul,’ and in the forward he discusses how this novel was his own Personal Legend. ‘I was living my own metaphor,’ he said, being thrilled just to get it picked up by a Brazilian publisher who, in 1988, only ran 900 copies assuming it would not be a big success. The book ended up taking off, with the 1993 English translation becoming a massive hit and lead to numerous further translations. Coelho even holds a Guinness World Record for “most translations of a single title signed by the author in 1 sitting”, signing his book in 53 different translated editions at a book event in Germany. So I can really appreciate that aspect, and his own personal journey into publishing and believing in himself is honestly better than the book itself. 
  Fun fact: The Alchemist had a big boost in sales when then-President Bill Clinton was photographed reading it.For those who don’t know, the story follows a young boy, Santiago, as he journeys across the desert and meets a lot of interesting people along the way. Literally every person has a pearl of positive wisdom to share it seems, and it becomes a rapid fire of empowerment quotes that could all go on one of those inspirational posters made for office walls in the 90s. Actually, I’m fairly certain I’ve seen one that quoted this book. The characters all feel like a mouthpiece for Coehlo to pass along his positive message, or wisdom, and one can easily imagine this being a self-help book had he not decided to attach a fictional narrative to it. It is a nice message, that you have to believe in yourself and in your goals and, if you truly do (“only those who are true of heart” vibes like in fairy tales) the universe will conspire to help you achieve your goal. Which is a nice inspirational message and sometimes that is what you need to hear to break free from self doubt. Particularly as another primary message is that we must overcome fear to accomplish what we need to do. ‘Don't give in to your fears,’ Coelho writes, ‘If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.’ So great, yea, believe in yourself. I dig that.‘To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.’I do, however, see it as a bit of a back-patting perspective. Like yes, if you are successful it is nice to feel like it is because you are pure of heart. He tells us that those who don’t follow their dreams end up in ruin and sadness. This is sort of a success fallacy in a way, as it implies that if things are bad its because you just didn’t try hard enough. Which…ehhhhh…I mean there are a lot of forces acting in society that gatekeep and sometimes it’s more than just not overcoming adversity. And I get it, keep trying, yea, but it feels a bit like shaming? Which is honestly overthinking it though as this book is not that nuanced or deep (something I kept saying during debates over minor details during book club: “I don’t think he even considered that and its beside the point because it’s not actually that deep”). It is meant to be a fun and empowering story that paints in broad strokes and yea, I get why it means a lot to many people. For me it just seemed a bit flat and like a snack when I wanted a meal.‘Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.’ Okay, fine, I don’t know how to write a good book or how to live my life either, but I just know this one wasn’t it for me.I did appreciate how it was aimed at a general positive idea of spirituality that, while using different religions, was not necessarily religious. Spiritual, or mystic would seem the better term. I liked the idea of the universe, the sand, the wind, etc as conscious entities that can collaborate with you. While I really disliked the deus ex machina ending, the whole idea of the world as a spiritual presence was well done. Coelho does sort of pull an orientalism in his depiction as an outsider of the region as this wild and savage land full of wise sages and cutthroat robbers, but it does seem with the aim of capturing the feel of One Thousand and One Nights or other tales of adventure and ‘finding yourself’ in exotic locale. Which I think is a topic that people have had a more nuanced discussion on since this book was written.‘It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting,’ Coelho writes, and this I can agree with. However, in The Alchemist, the general tone of the book is that dreams seem a thing only for men. Fatima, Santiago’s love interest, lacks much agency in the tale and is more or less written as a prize for following his Personal Legend. She is an element of his journey, while I guess he is all her journey gets to be. He tells her ‘I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you,’ which…isn’t all that romantic or great? Hey, the universe popped you into my life, guess you’ll do for a bride. C’mon, man, does she have any personality or intelligence you enjoy and don’t just tell me how beautiful she is. Didn’t vibe with any of that aspect of the book.I also didn’t really like the ending. Sure it is riffing on the whole “it’s the journey not the destination” aspect but it felt a bit flat for me with the deus ex machina moment. It is a happy ending though, and one full of success and rewards. As a bookclub member pointed out, it sort of resonates with a quote by T.S. Eliot: ‘We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.’So in the end, I’m mostly ambivalent to this book. I see why people enjoy it and it is admittedly pretty and sweet and uplifting. It’s a good vibe to be in. It didn’t do much for me, but that’s alright too. 2.5/5[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",2
"847","18144590","tl;dr - important message, disappointing execution.for this to have been described as a story that changes lives, im a little let down. whilst this certainly had the potential to be ‘life changing,’ i felt there were many aspects which kept the story from delivering what could have been a meaningful experience. firstly, this is told like a parable. i would consider this story to fall more along the lines of religious allegory than philosophical text. that, in itself, is neither here nor there. however, i read somewhere that effective parables should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. unfortunately, this book does neither of those things - it pampers to the egos of the self-righteous and chastises those who dont adhere to certain values. which is a shame, because this was supposed to be a story about following ones heart by chasing dreams and passions. too bad that message got lost somewhere along the way. secondly, i didnt connect with the any of characters, as i found them to be very two-dimensional. for a story that was meant to be about personal growth, i did not get any sense of emotion in the writing. a boy sells his entire livelihood, sets sail for distant continent, and crosses an entire desert in search of something he desperately desires - and yet, i couldnt care less about his journey. also, the portrayal of women in this is frustratingly poor. anyways, i liked the idea. i personally try to live my life by many of the lessons and teachings in this book - i believe it is important for one to follow their dreams, to always listen to their heart, and to never give up on something they are passionate about (as much as realistically possible). but i think the effectiveness of those messages was lost in this story. ↠ 2.5 stars",3
"848","18144590","Homework for ""Introductory Course For Irony Disposal And Sarcasm Removal (ICFIDASR)"", lesson one, re-submission number 47.I once read a book that inspired me to change my whole attitude towards reading. It was a medicine of universal, cosmic impact. Before, I had thought that books existed to enrich me, giving me knowledge, pleasure and understanding. After reading the introductory pages of this ""enchanting novel"" however, I learned that more wisdom can be gained from the companionship of sheep than from books, as stated by the wise young protagonist, a shepherd who uses books for a pillow and sheep for dialogue partners (it is a one-way road, with the sheep as teachers, for the sheep don't learn anything from him). In simple, unsophisticated prose, which seems to be carefully following the rubric of a Grade 6 descriptive writing assignment, I read:""The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and - once in a while - their meat.""Learning to take everything literally is part of my course, so I try not to see a metaphor in the fact that the boy learns more from sheep than from books. But I do have a question or two:If the sheep are only his""friends"" as long as he brings them food, do they really count as friends? Are they not just following their needs?Is it not quite self-evident that they have not read any books in their young lives - they are sheep after all, and won't read in their old age either, I assume?Do they really ""generously offer their wool, their company, and -ONCE IN A WHILE - their meat? At least as far as the meat is concerned, I am sure they offer it once, and not again, and not by free choice, and generously?As this book is to be taken seriously, I beg to accept my apology if my questions sound like sarcasm. That is not my intention. I am really just asking ""all universe to conspire to help me achieve my goal"" (another piece of wisdom the book offers) - of understanding how anyone can take this seriously! I just wonder how all universe deals with opposing wishes, which must occasionally occur, even in a small place like our earth. If I for example wish to have my neighbour's garden chair, and my neighbour wishes to keep it, who does ""all universe"" side with, and how does it conspire to help me get it, and at the same time to help my neighbour to keep it?Things that happen once can never happen again, I also learn. Before I can even ask why, I get another piece of information: Things that happen twice will always happen again. How does that go together? If things have happened once (which is a prerequisite for happening twice in my world) they won't happen again?!? Whatever is meant, things can NEVER happen twice, that is sure. I can't travel to Italy twice. If I do it anyway (which is not possible) I will definitively do it again. That is nice!When I do travel to Italy (once, or three times), my life and my path will always provide me with enough omens. That is interesting, and I do not know why I all of a sudden associate this with the sheepish followers in Life Of Brian, who found omens in sandals.Call me literal-minded, but I do have some issues with the idea of omen provision. Can I order them online nowadays? What do they cost? To close my reflection on learning more from sheep than books, I have to say: In some cases, that is very true! What a bitter medicine!As with all medicines, there are some side effects, and it is very important to read the warning before you take this drug:Please do not read this book if you are in danger of thinking too rationally. When you read this Grade 6 essay, be careful to check if you show behaviours that you would define as out of character, as they might be symptoms of acute drivel reading allergy. Symptoms include: anger, frustration, ridicule, frowning, nausea, meaningless giggling, dreams about book burning, urge to throw the book in the bin or out the window. Symptoms may vary, but in all cases, it is recommended to suspend reading until the brain is reset in adequate sheep mode again. If symptoms do not diminish after enjoying a couple of good, real books, please see your librarian for memory removal surgery or therapy.",1

Really, this is one of the earliest novels I read when I began reading recreationally.- I remember at the time not getting what all the hype was about and thought it, while quite well done, was fairly ordinary.- It'll be interesting to see if I'll change my tune at all after so many years.(2) No real chapter breaks, which is a shame. I like boundaries.06/09/2024 - Prologue(1) You know, I'd just been wondering why the original cover art was ""Narcissus"" by Caravaggio. I couldn't understand why. Well, the prologue answered that question immediately albeit not directly.- My first thought is it's symbolic of this book in concept. The prologue tells the story of Narcissus, but then adds to it. Which is to say this book might use existing folklore as a base to build its fiction upon.06/12/2024 - Andalusia(1) Melchizedek's interesting. He says he's the Biblical King of Salem, who dealt with Abraham. So, he's either a liar/conman or in some way divine.- You'd think Santiago, who attended seminary, would be either awed or skeptical. He seems neither.- Presuming he's divine, the way he disrupts Santiago's life, overturning the status quo, makes him an archetypical trickster.- This is magical realism, I suppose.06/13/2024 - Tangier(1) ""The boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone.""- True, albeit cynical. You're never alone because people want your money.- Of course, it implies the inverse is also true. Losing all his money means he's now really alone and has no ability to make things magically happen.(2) This whole Tangier section is about blessings in disguise and not settling for the familiar.06/14/2024 (1) - The Caravan and Oasis(1) ""Once you get into the desert, there's no going back, and, when you can't go back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward.""- That's the difference between the Crystal Merchant, who looks back and never sees Mecca, and the Englishman, who builds a forge in the desert.- This whole section is like one big Nike ad. So many metaphors all amounting to the same ""Just Do It!"" call to action.06/14/2024 (2) - The Desert(1) It's interesting how figures here tie themselves into a Biblical lineage, as if to imply this story is Biblical as well.- We saw this previously with the old man who insisted he was the Biblical Melchizedek.- At the oasis, the tribal elder says they were the very people who purchased Joseph and brought him to Egypt.- Like Joseph, Santiago is a foreigner who saves the locals and is made a court official.06/15/2024 (1) - The Military Camp(1) It's around this point in the book that you realize the titular ""Alchemist"" isn't the alchemist character, but Santiago.- Because turning lead into gold is a metaphor for leaving a mundane life to pursue treasure.(2) ""Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.""- Hitting rock bottom usually spurs people into action.- That's why the boy was robbed of everything three times.06/15/2024 (2) - Epilogue(1) Ultimately, this is one of those ""it's not you it's me"" books.- I can understand why it inspires so many people and why it's one of the most popular books on this site.- But (call me jaded, cynical or a grump) the book-long refrain that the universe conspires to make your dreams come true just seems quixotic and trite.(2) Overall, a better experience than before, but nothing to make me change my rating.",4

So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there's a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with.NO.NO.NO.NO.This book is NOT:- erotic/sexy- funny, even ironically- endearing- full of sexual taboosThis book IS:- repetitive- plotless (well, you knew that)- painful to get through- depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable- how to not write a novel- how to gain success by using other people's characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bankMost people know about the twilight matchups so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details:Bella Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in Arizona Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to Forks Vancouver, Washington where her dad stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in Florida Georgia. She has a younger friend named Jacob Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and police force army buddies, and who gave her his old truck VW beetle.Edward Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named Emmett Elliott and a sister named Alice Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents Carlisle Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn't even change the first three letters?) and Esme Grace. Their father mother is a doctor. Rose Kate and Jasper Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens.Also, he 'dazzles' her.I can't even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn't change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it 'different' enough to publish as is. It's quite disgusting.Alright, continuing on, and once again, I'm sure you've heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him. Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there's the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she's not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that's all into the sex. It's strange because I'm also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it's written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It's funny because she's supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. This is sense. Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24:“Through the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.”What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry?Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest:Through the haze of light, I squint and see ,Christian leaning over me, Smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.That's almost better.Let's have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more:“I didn't put that song on my iPod,” he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway.What? He knows what he's doing, the bastard. Who did? And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. Who...who?The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. Who? Who? I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who?SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU.Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing's worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it's based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and naïve. I didn't realize. I'm sorry. You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You're like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. I can't even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book.And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I'm going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly:Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main charactersInciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the storyPlot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etcMidpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it's a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinkingPlot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflictClimax: final showdown or decisions needed to be madeResolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or anotherBasically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you'll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn't wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there's enough substance there. And since that's a lot of vagueness, we'll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney's Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict:Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one.And the seven sentence story: Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn't want to be stuck in a mundane life.Inciting Incident: Belle's father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle.Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle.Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent.Plot Point 2: Belle's father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he's giving up his chances of being with her.Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast.Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. Okay, so let's try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.)Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU.Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he's hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry.Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he's into S&M. Also they have sex.Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. Plot Point 2: Nah, she's still deciding and whining about how he's kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2.Climax: Well there isn't really one, it's just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess...Resolution: She says he's too weird and ends it. What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you've gotten this far, nope.But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn't really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that's how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can't wait to see them get back together and whine some more.And let's talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you'll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it's pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he's taking it easier on her since she's inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn't sound fun.And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that's not even a surprise (although imo it's not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn't going to be a mess in the morning.Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things:-I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. “I'm gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.” ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don't get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I fired up my email.” BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED.-They actually do the “you hang up” “no you hang up” “no you” that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross.-Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn't 'experienced enough to understand,' lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It's not what he's doing, it's how he's doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it's for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the naïve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help.-He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I'm joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she's at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She's supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can't stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn't seen in 6 months. I can't at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can't stay away.It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I've hated about past relationships I've had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book? How does anyone think that this is sexy, that this depicts something they want?I can't even.I cannot.(Also I should never have imagined Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl as the main characters. Now everytime I see a commercial for Gossip Girl, rage courses through my body.)I'm bored. Someone get me out of here.P.S. Did you know that James recently stated she's set the bar for writing pretty high?Cool.Please, do yourself a favor and go buy a book of much higher quality plot and writing, ohhhh like....Modelland.",1
"853","10818853","What in the hell just happened? Did I really read that? Oh, my god, I did. I did read that. Meet Anastasia Steele:
  Ana is just a giant mess of a human being. She's insecure to the point of it being laughable, 'klutzy' (even though she only trips twice in the entire book), and a complete ditz. She's a virgin (of course) who's never taken any sexual interest in anyone before. Right. I'm fairly certain there hasn't been a woman this naive since 'round about 1954. At one point, she thinks putting her hair in pigtails will keep her safe from Christian's lusty advances. Fuckin' really? She ""flushes"" constantly, and on several occasions referred to her hoo-hoo-naughty place as ""down there.""
  Next, we have Christian Grey:
  Christian is a misogynistic, self-loathing, abusive piece of shit. Apparently, his only redeeming qualities are, in this order; his ridiculous good looks, his money, and his giant penis. The only time Ana seems to like him as a person is when he's being ""lovable"", and those times are few and far between. Most of the time he's serious, brooding, and threatening. How charming.I knew from the very first line this wasn't going to be good. 
  ""I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.""
 It was cemented that early, my deep, deep dislike for this moronic, simpering asshole. Your hair won't behave? Guess what?
  My suspicions were confirmed a few pages later when Ana admits that any ""sympathy"" she feels for her sick friend is ""unwelcome"". Unwelcome, apparently because her friend is beautiful, even when she has the flu...? What a petty, jealous cunt. The only thing that made the first 4% of this book tolerable was the fact that I read it aloud to my younger brother, and his frequent commentary was amusingly distracting. Once he gave up, however, I had to travel the rest of the road alone. What a painful journey it was. My first impressions of Ana were bad (deservedly so). What were my first impressions of Christian? Well...
  That's how I felt about Christian Grey. From the beginning. Any time an author tries to sell me on a character's ""charm"" by waxing hormonal about how ""ridiculously good-looking"" he is, I snicker inwardly. I can't think why....
  Huh.Anyway, after reading about the description of Christian's building (hello, first penis metaphor), I had to sit through the awful dialogue between these smarmy idiots and hope beyond hope that something, anything, would distract me enough to see me through to the end. Turns out, I found something about 15% through. I went back and counted, and kept track throughout the rest of the book, and do you have any idea how many fucking times Ana said ""Oh my"" in this monumentally bad missive? Do you? I'll tell you; 79! 79 motherfucking times. ""He pulled me back against his chest...oh my."" ""He began kissing a trail down my belly, oh my."" ""He's an insufferable douchenozzle, oh my!"" (I'm just thankful that neither lions, tigers, nor bears were brought into this mess at any point.)
  About halfway through, I wished I'd been keeping track of the word ""crap"" because Ana is constantly saying/thinking it. Crap, Holy Crap, Double and Triple Crap, Oh Crap, This Crap, That Crap, any and all Crap. Speaking of crap, if I ever, ever ever have to hear/read the words ""inner goddess"" again, I'm going to construct a pyre out of tampons and maxi pads, light it, and toss unsuspecting women into it. 
  ^My inner goddess will cap yours in the face if you don't shut the fuck up^I'm sorry, I just couldn't take any of this seriously. His playroom. His playroom? Really?
  Or how about his weird-ass issues with food? He wants the girl slim and in shape, yet he won't stop trying to force her to eat!
  I simply love the attempt E.L. James made at giving these pathetic shells personalities. Ana wears Converse, drives a vintage car, and likes classic British lit. *Yawn* haven't heard any of that before. And Christian; we know Christian's super deep and sophisticated because he plays the piano and listens to obscure classical music. This is how we know Edward Christian is really just a lost soul in need of love; his love of music. Everyone knows that no one threatening listens to music. Music lovers just aren't capable of doing anything bad.
  ^Surprise! Psychos like music, too.^Since this is considered nothing more than ""mommy porn"", I will attempt to pander to that particular demographic for a moment. Were the sex scenes well-written? Well, none of it was particularly well-written. The sex scenes could be kind of...honestly, they were kind of boring. I've had more exciting sex myself, so I guess reader response to the sex scenes is dependent on reader experience. There's nothing revolutionary here, and a lot of it is just plain unrealistic. I mean, come on, he pretty much jackhammers her hymen and she walks away with nothing more than a passing, pleasant soreness? Riiiight. How about the time he gives her a handjob with a soapy washcloth? Hello? Apparently neither one of them has ever heard of a urinary tract infection. Oh, or we could talk about her first time giving Christian a blowjob, during which Ana established herself as some kind of Queen of Deepthroat.
  Anyone wanna hear about the tampon scene? Oh, you've already heard about the tampon scene? Yeah, same here, although hearing about it and reading the actual scene are a bit different. For some reason, you imagine it being worse than it actually is, while at the same time, reading about it is more horrifying than you could possibly imagine. 
  ""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string...what! And...gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet.""

  Look, I'm not against sex during menses, but a guy plucking out a girl's tampon? Yeah, gross. I'm not a prude, but there are certain lines people just shouldn't cross. What makes it worse is that Christian is just thrilled that Ana's raggin' because he hates using condoms.
  Apparently, Mr. GinormoDick doesn't know that a woman can get pregnant while on her period. Which is hilarious considering all the teaching and training he's doing to remedy Ana's sexual ignorance. Sexual dependence, thy name is Anastasia Steele. We're supposed to believe that this girl has gone 21 years neither having had sex nor masturbating? Hm. Well, Christian's supposed sexual prowess makes a bit more sense now, as does Ana's assertion that he has a giant bologna wand. She has absolutely zero experience, and she's never once had anything ""in there"". Thing could be the size of a baby carrot and she'd still be like, ""Oh, my glob! How is it ever going to fit?!"" It's good that she stockpiled all those potential orgasms, though, because now she's capable of having like, 15 a day or something. It's ridiculous. Come to think of it, Christian's obsession with her eating habits makes a bit more sense now. She was probably beginning to look like something out of a horror movie.
  Seriously, though, are we going to take the word of a girl who is apparently so undersexed she's never even masturbated? I guess I can sort of understand this obsession with some kind of an awakening, but...really? ""Oh, he's soooo good in bed!"" How the hell would she know?! She has absolutely nothing with which to compare, not even her own damn hand! 
  Now I'll be totally honest, the biggest issue I have with Fifty Shades of Shit is neither the sex nor the horrible writing. It's the plot. Thin as it is, it's still there, its core message being that, given enough time, you can change someone. While I don't have any problem with this if all you're trying to do is help them to lose weight or quit smoking, when you're talking about an emotionally and (dangerously close to) physically abusive relationship, sending that kind of message is ridiculous and irresponsible. Christian is controlling, possessive, condescending, and cruel. He doesn't allow Ana to behave as she normally would, and Ana just puts up with it, insistent that if she can give him what he wants, when he wants, as often as he wants, she can eventually begin to pull his strings. Will it work? In the books, probably. In real life? No. Almost never. How many misguided women are going to waste their lives on some emotionally retarded prick because they've read shit like this and think this kind of fucked-up fairytale will come true for them? I've known women with this mentality. ""Oh, he's so dark and dangerous and threatening, but he's got a sad, lonely side, and if I could just figure out what's wrong, I could change him!"" 
  Wake the fuck up! He may be hot, he may have a huge dick, he may even be rich, that doesn't make him a good person. It doesn't even make him a potentially good person. Quit.Being.A.Fucking.Idiot. (Look, I can make my words Staccato like Christian. Now hold still while I choke you until you pass out...)
  ^Ana and Christian^ - ""I said don't roll your eyes at me!!""Christian stalks Ana (which she turns into a fucking joke), and whispers things to her ""threateningly"". She's constantly afraid he's going to beat the crap out of her, and with good reason as he, on more than one occasion, tells her he's going to/wants to.Potential rape is downplayed. Ana's friend, Jake Jose, starts pushing himself on her rather vehemently when they're both drunk. Ana repeatedly says no, but Jose just keeps trying to go in for the kill. Admiral Chaps busts on up with his riding crop, however, and saves her. Ana (understandably) avoids Jose for a while after that, and when her other friend asks her why, all Ana says is, ""He made a pass at me."" Later on, she and Jose are friends again, the ""attempted kiss"" forgotten. *Sigh*Rapists appear to be a theme. Christian tells Ana that he gets off on having complete and total control over another person. This is not just in the bedroom, but in Ana's overall life. On several occasions, he fails to yield when Ana says no, plunging on regardless, assured she'll like whatever he does, anyway, so why bother stopping?
  And there are women out there who think this is romantic.
  I wish you the best of luck, ladies. Just keep in mind that while you're fantasizing about abusive, misogynistic assholes like Grey, there are a lot of women dealing with the horrors of actually living with men like him. For all you ladies bustin' out your toys while daydreaming about Hunky Mr. Grey, I want you to do something for me. It'll only take a moment. Close your eyes. Think about all the things Christian Grey does in the book. Not just those supposed sweet things, but really, everything. His condescension, his control, his insane jealousy, his threats.....and now....imagine he looks like this:
  Still turned on? The end of the book was absolutely hilarious, with Ana fleeing in emotional tumult because Christian can't give her what she needs (love! *sniff*).
  And we're treated to her alternately being angry about the pain and humiliation she faced at Christian's hands, and chastising herself for being a failure and for being mean to Christian. It really is classic abuse mentality. Yet I see her being touted by some as ""strong and independent"". It's this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I've ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled (outside of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It's a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn't even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It's about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is 'like, the best thing ever, OMG'. It's trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that this is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does good men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice. 
  *Sigh*A bestseller. They're thinking of turning it into a movie....I can't....

  Fifty Shades of Shit
Haters, please exit stage left.I'm not sure what possessed me to pick up Fifty Shades of Grey. I thought I might genuinely like it before I started, but all I was left with was one hell of a mindfuck. Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series.Recently I discovered one of my favorite publishers, Random House, has picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and made this statement:""An orig­i­nal work, and said to us that James had war­ranted the books were, indeed orig­i­nal. Mes­sitte added she was “aware of the nar­ra­tive that [50 SHADES] started as dif­fer­ently titled piece of fic­tion, but that they were and are two dis­tinctly sep­a­rate pieces of work.""I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to call bull shit on that. Fifty Shades of Grey and Master of the Universe (the original fan fic) are essentially the same thing. The biggest difference being Edward and Bella's name being replaced with Christian and Anastasia respectively. And I would know this because I have both and while I was reading, I would occasionally switch back and forth between the two without difficulty. I'd go through and give you examples myself, but other people have done it already here and here. So if you must read this book, do yourself a solid and find the fan fic online. You even get the second book too!I know some people claim this has no similarities to Twilight and got dammit, I'm allergic to all the bull shit. Do I really need to point this all out? Because it looks pretty obvious to me. The mannerisms of the characters are exactly the same. They even say similar things the original characters say. The whole ""dazzle"" line and Edward asking Bella to trust him. Her mother being remarried with the same inability to maneuver her way around a kitchen. Bella is still trying to save Edward from himself due to his troubled past. Edward still stalks and controls Bella, only now he gets to hit her when she gets out of line.*facepalm* Shall I beat them both? Yes?I struggled to come up with a proper review for this book and couldn't figure out why I was feeling rather uninspired to write one. And then I figured it out. I was left so disgusted by this book that I wanted to purge the memory of its existence from my mind. With a rusty nail. Every time I thought of the book my brain cells would go on strike, yelling obscenities at me.  Anyway, I thought Bella and Edward's relationship couldn't get anymore fucked up than Twilight. I stand corrected. If I were to describe FSoG in one sentence it would be this: Fifty Shades of Grey is like Twilight on steroids, high on ecstasy, in a dirty little corner. A very dirty corner. With badly written sex. Lots.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of the beautiful (but of course she doesn't know it), naive virgin, Anastasia Steal after she is suckered into interviewing the Greek god, Christian Grey. Of course, sparks fly and for some unknown reason he can't seem to stay away from this incredibly, unremarkable girl.  Ana discovers Christian is into BDSM and desires her as his submissive fuck buddy.There are a myriad of problems with this novel, many of which ironically can be found in Twilight. Never saw that one coming! Christian/Edward is still a controlling bastard, only now he hides behind his BDSM practices to camouflage his abusive tendencies. However, Ana doesn't see it that way. She thinks of him as a broken person and it's her duty to fix him. Even when he says things like this:""I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn't take.""Can you believe she let's him beat her after that? And please don't even bother to tell me that it's just BDSM. No, just fucking no. Ana is genuinely afraid of Christian and is never entirely comfortable with the ""punishment"" aspect of their relationship. But Christian just manipulates her with sex to continue the relationship. And that's what really gets me. I just have a hard time believing a virgin would somehow become a sex goddess overnight, because that is exactly what happens. When she first is introduced to his kinky lifestyle and tells him she is a virgin he immediately tells her he needs to handle that ""situation"" before they could continue. What?! Since when is your virginity a ""situation?"" But, that's not really the kicker. Oh, no, because that is when we are introduced to Ana's two best friends. Everyone say hi to:
  Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Anna's inner goddess, who always cheers her on when Christian wants sex or wants to punish her. She's also quite annoying, doing back flips at the mention of anything sexual related. Simmer down. Where did she come from exactly? Ana is in her twenties and has never felt the urge to have sex with anyone until Christian comes along with his whips and chains?!And... Ana's sub-conscious, who hides behind couches when it comes time for her beating. When it comes to Ana having sex with Christian, well, her sub-conscious only has one thing to say,
  So after the ""situation"" is handled, Ana has to sign a ""contract"" agreeing to his sexual demands and also outlining things she won't do. It was pretty pointless considering he still got what he wanted and she never signed the damn thing. He exploits her, stalks her and abuses her! She cries after sex. She is afraid of him being angry! Even when he is angry at something else, she thinks it's her. Her reasoning for allowing him to hit her as his therapy is because she's afraid to lose him. That is not a reason for agreeing to a BDSM lifestyle! In fact, that's not even really ""consent!"" These quotes just scream domestic abuse to me:""Please don't be angry with me,"" I whisper.""Please don't hit me,"" I whisper, pleading.His brow furrows, his eyes widening. He blinks twice.""I don't want you to spank me. Not here. Not now. Please don't.""Yeah, he's a real catch, that one. Barf. No, excuse me. That's not right. The barfing came when the little ass-wipe PULLED HER TAMPON OUT AND RAMMED HIMSELF INSIDE OF HER. OMFG. Yes, the caps were totally necessary because that was the most disgusting thing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. That is not sexy, that's foul.Whenever Ana thinks about leaving him, he comes over to her apartment unannounced pounds into her (literally) and her inner goddess does a fucking happy dance, forgetting her urge to kick his sick ass to the curb. They fight, they breakup. They kiss, they sex up.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Christian: ""Do you still want me gone Ana?""Inner goddess: *growl*Sub-conscious: ...
  Dance, puppet. Dance.The writing is a shitty mess too. I mean, if I had to sit and read Ana saying ""Holy, shit!"" or ""Holy, Fuck!"" or ""Oh, my!"" one more time, I was going to lose it. I wanted to take my red pen and have at this ""book"" so badly. It was the little things like Ana's roommate saying over and over, ""You never cry Ana,"" and what do we find Ana always doing? Crying. I'm not sure where the hell the plot was. *smacks forehead* How silly of me! Didn't I mention this was a Twilight retelling? Why was I expecting a plot? And another example of poor writing: for these characters to be American, they sounded very British to me. They used phrases that Americans don't use.And now I'm trying to figure out why this book is so popular. Why do so many women love this book? I get the appeal of the bondage even though it's not my usual cup of tea. Whips? Chains? Sounds exciting!Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...
  Abuse? Not so much.Fuck my life! Zero stars!Eh, I'm off to read a good book now and possibly to bleach my brain.More reviews at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.",1
"855","10818853","In the words of Miss Steele, ""You need to sort your shit out, Grey!"" Good day, sir!Fifty Shades of Grey, more like Fifty shades of fucked up nonsense *rolls eyes* I should get a medal for just finishing this tripe. I honestly do NOT feel like revisiting this book and writing a review. I’d rather spend the time searching for ways to remove this utter nonsense from my memory. However, this book is so bad that I feel the need to warn others from this drivel. Luckily, I did not buy this garbage. I do not even know what overcame me to read it and I can only blame a momentary lack of judgment on my part.What baffles me is the scary fangirlgasm following this book. So what’s causing it a hit? I can only come up with ‘twilight’. Doing some research, this book was originally posted online as a twilight fanfic! Yes, a twilight fanfic. The fact that this book’s source material isn’t a good piece of literature just shows what you should expect from this book. And dubbing it a twilight fanfic and promoting it as such is no doubt raising the bar on the sale figures. What has the world come to? *headdesk* Whatever’s causing its success; I can safely say it can’t be the book itself.Everything you could possibly imagine is wrong with this book! The execution and the characters. And the writing. And the plot (wait, was there one?!?)Firstly, it has been said a countless number of times how abusive Bella and Edward’s relationship was. And it is arguably the most anti-feminist portrayal of any relationship. FSoG simply continues this unhealthy view and promotes an even more abusive and degrading relationship towards women, targeting older women (and possibly even teenage girls who know no better). Oh dear god, I hope teenage girls do not jump on this disturbing bandwagon. Surely, it is degrading to ask a woman to sign a contract where ‘she is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases’ and ‘submitting [herself] to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant…without hesitation or argument’ – especially when you take into consideration the fact that she would be signing up to something she has not yet experienced and knows little about as she is still a virgin. This is not something that should be promoted as desirable or idealistic. This book cheapens what feminists have fought for years! Don’t get me wrong I wouldn't deprive women of their right to express themselves sexually, nor to act upon their desires but I shudder at the thought of women aspiring to a relationship where she will take part in various things that she is not comfortable with and at times, even when she’s genuinely in fear of taking part, simply because she finds the guy ‘hot’.The plot - I’m not even sure if there was one. 50% of the book is spent talking about sex/the contract and the other 50% is made up of clumsily written sex scenes. FSoG starts of with Anastasia Steele agreeing to interview the billionaire, Christian Grey. Miss Steele is instantly captivated by Mr Grey’s dashing looks and within 2 days she falls in love with him. Mr Grey for some unfathomable reason can’t keep away from her and reveals to her his secret kinky lifestyle. The two spend the rest of the romantic evening calmly discussing the contract that allows him to fuck her senseless. She reveals to him that she’s a virgin and his only response, he needs to handle that ‘situation’. Really?!? The next 4 days, he gets to do exactly what he wants, he stalks her, abuses her and punishes her by spanking her several times. Quotes that spring to mind – “Please don’t hit me…don’t be angry with me…don’t want you to spank me” Aww, isn’t that romantic? Atleast, she finally sees some sense and walks out. The writing is dull and unimaginative. It reads more like a diary – he did this, I did this. The constant repetitions are enough to make someone suicidal! I hope I never have to see the words, ‘my subconscious’ and ‘my inner goddess’ ever again or so help me god! The sex scenes were terrible and frankly a little disturbing to put down on paper – an incident with the tampon springs to mind.The characters are simply absurd in this book. AnaBella SteeleSwan Anastasia Steele irked me quite a lot and reading this book from her point of view was no picnic in the park. Finding out that she is 21 years old was a shock – she reads like a dim-witted 12 year old, who’s vocabulary doesn’t extend further from ‘jeez’, ‘oh crap’, ‘damn’, ‘oh my’, ‘holy cow’ and even the constant reference to her vagina as ‘down there’. I found nothing remotely interesting about her. She has most of Bella’s traits and then some – she’s boring, clumsy and downright bitter, even towards her best friend, Kate. The only other word I can use to describe her is a ‘scrounger’ – can’t she afford her own clothes? She’s too gullible and a hypocrite. She’s weak-willed and succumbs so easily for my liking. And I’m pretty sure she suffers from some form of mental disorder – schizophrenia perhaps? She constantly refers to what she calls her ‘inner goddess’ and her ‘subconscious’, who either cheer her on when there’s an opportunity for sex or take opportunities to call her a ‘dirty hoe’! “My subconscious asks me, her eyebrow figuratively raised…My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration…My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon specs…My subconscious - she’s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt…______________________________________________My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatientlyMy inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa movesMy inner goddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers,My inner goddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina, pirouette after pirouetteMy inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms, is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast, is standing on the podium awaiting her gold medal, has back flipped off the podium and is doing cartwheels around the stadium, bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream, looks like someone snatched her ice cream. My inner goddess is not pleased”  Kill me now!I swear Kate was a much more interesting character and would have made a better female lead, but like the other few characters she was mentioned only for the sake of a story. A real shame.Christian Grey…where do I begin?______________________________________________From: KrutiSubject: Your issuesDate: April 18 2011 23:15To: Christian GreyDear Mr Grey,You sir, are a pompous asshole!

But not beyond anything you couldn't take.""Christian GreyCEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc._____________________________________________There are simply so many things wrong with his character that I don’t even know where to begin. What’s unacceptable is how his upbringing is used as an excuse to cover up his abusive tendencies. NO!! That does not give him the right to exert control over her and abuse her. Ana constantly tells him how uncomfortable and afraid she is with what he wants and all he can say is 'That’s a Dom/sub thing. You’ll get used to it.'. Hell NO! That's not BDSM. Okay children, let's explore the definition of BDSM: ""form of personal relationship involving the consensual use of restraint.."" Consensual being the key word! Don't tell me we have two consenting adults here. No, Ana is just a child trapped in a woman's body. She has no true idea of what this lifestyle entails and is at most times in fear.If you're still not convinced about how unhealthy this relationship was, this probably will convince you. To ensure he gets her to do what he wants, he manipulates her with promises of a relationship if she is willing to try his way of lifestyle. And, Ana being the fool she is lets him beat her thinking 'Oh my, holy cow he's hot' and 'It’s what he wants...after all he’s done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs'. So in her mind, his need to control her and beat her is a form of therapy? No! That's not BDSM either.I have absolutely nothing more to add. I'm taking my inner goddess elsewhere and grabbing a good book.Extras: Honestly this is what I imagined Christian to be like.

"856","10818853","Garbage. Absolutely horrifying, utter trash. A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published? Every single book store in Sydney is promoting this tripe, claiming it to be some kind of awesome romance novel. Are you absolutely shitting me? There is nothing romantic at all about this 'book'. And I don't mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin' thing. In fact, that's what this book should be called. 'Fifty shades of absolute-fucking-insanity-and-abuse'. I know at least every one star reviewer has taken the title and created their own pun with it, but fuck it, I'm jumping on the bandwagon too. Before I decided to read this (God help me), I kept seeing it everywhere I went, and the book store where I work was involved in the promotion among other book store chains. Typical. All me and my co-workers knew that it was smut, and a hell of a lot of it too. We even turned the book into a drinking game, and it goes as thus: Flip to a random page of the book. If it's something dirty, take a drink. I do not recommend this game, for one could die from alcohol poisoning within the first round. But if you're feeling adventurous... by all means. Glad I could be of service to your crazy party ideas. But anyway, let's cut to my opinion of this abomination of literature. I decided to read it because it sounded like garbage, and I haven't written a review about garbage in too long. I owed something to the people who actually found me worthwhile to follow on Goodreads. So I decided hell, I'll review this. Brain cells I will never, ever, EVER, get back.This is literally the worst book I have ever read, and I say that about many books. But this is the worst book for a damn good reason. Let's talk about what I hated about this book. The bottom line is I hated absolutely everything. And I'm not saying that to be funny, I'm saying that out of all seriousness. I didn't find a single redeeming quality in this book. With the Hush, hush series we at least had the unintentional hilarity and the awesomeness of Marcie. In Twilight we had that chick who wanted to kill Bella and Tyler's van. Fifty shades of Grey has no such redeeming qualities. The characters are bland and merely props to set the stage for fucking weird BDSM-ing, and the plot was lost somewhere in the vagina of the author's wet dream. (Believe me, I feel weird for even typing these words.) Not to mention, even though everyone already knows this, this was originally a Twilight fan fiction called 'Master of the universe' or some shitty, stupid title like that. How did such a thing get published? What, Twilight wasn't horrible and abuse-glorifying enough, so we had to kick it up a notch with publishing 'Master of the universe'? Are you people serious? Why is it that dumber and dumber things are getting published? Quality is almost non-existent. Fucking hell. But before I rant on for hours about that, let's talk about the characters. Oh, I mean props. Yeah, props is more appropriate. Why? Because the characters, for all the personality they had may as well have been props. Our first main prop is Ana, aka Bella Swan. The plain, virginal wallflower who thinks lowly of herself whilst everyone around her just seems to freaking worship her. She is also clumsy, reads books, has divorced parents, doesn't get along with her step-father, and is a brain dead moronic twat. Remind you of anyone? I wonder who you're thinking of. That is a humdinger, isn't it? I'm amazed how many women are not pissed off with her complete lack of sense and self-respect. She lets a man abuse her physically and emotionally, and allows him to satiate his ever-growing need to control her completely, passing it off as some cute obsessive habit. And even if she has doubts and runs away, she comes running back to him only seconds after. How are people not pissed off about this? Seriously? Not to mention she has zero personality, zero brain-cells, and zero common sense. Her character serves no purpose other than becoming some abusive asshole's sex toy. And let's not forget our second main prop, Christian Grey, aka Edward Cullen, aka creepy-stalker-sociopathic-megalomaniacal-abusive-horrifying-asshole. The fact that he has fangirls in the real world has pretty much ruined my faith in mankind, and the new generation. Christian Gray pretty much pushes the limits that Edward Cullen, Patch, Daniel and others have yet to push due to their PG ratings, but fuck does Christian Grey push those fucking limits. He physically abuses Ana, and it somehow gets excused on the account that she was briefly aroused by it. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?? SERIOUSLY?? Fuck my life. He also decides what she should eat, what she should wear, how she should act, speak, communicate with him, where she can and can't go or what she can and can't do, threatens her constantly even with physical violence, and the list goes on. I kid you not. He even has this set out as a contract (which by the way is repeated at least 5 times in the fucking book). Here's another example of how romantic this mother fucker is:""I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don't, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.""See? Romantic as freaking Mel Gibson. And by the way, the women who find this guy romantic need some serious therapy. Seriously. Harsh I know, but finding this guy romantic is like like excusing the actions of a child-molester because he has nice hair. This is not romantic. This is ABUSIVE and WRONG on sooooo many levels.I don't know why they decided to plant this book in the general romance section. This is not romantic. And don't give me the 'IT'S MEANT TO BE BDSM, SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL DOM VS SUB'. This goes way beyond the good ol' BDSM theme and just ends up treading into abusive territory. Christian takes these aspects into the relationship where he ends up not only controlling a woman sexually, but also emotionally, and deliberately moulding her into not just a sex partner, but an ideal of what he wants her to be and leaves her no room for her individuality and instead brands it as 'punishable'. That's not part of the BDSM jig. I'm sorry, but it's not. Why people even call this romantic is beyond me. I already mentioned the abusive aspects of this so called relationship, but other than that it was a relationship built on air. Since neither of the characters had any personality outside their sex drives, they had nothing that they saw in each other. They couldn't relate to each other, they didn't share any common interests, they didn't do any good for each other, outside the sexy stuff. And at the end they want to pass it off as though the two are actually in love? Give me a break. Watching people get swooped at by magpies is more romantic that this garbage.The plot? There was no plot. Seriously, I could not find it. ANYWHERE. I searched and searched but alas, my search has left me unrewarded. Let me explain in a quick paragraph how this book goes:'Girl meets some guy. Some guy is hot. Girl thinks some guy is hot. Hot some-guy shows up where girl who thinks some-guy is hot works. Hot some-guy asks out girl, takes her virginity. Stuff happens. Hot some-guy introduces girl (who thinks he's hot, by the way) to his BDSM sex dungeon, and the next half of the book is spent pondering whether or not girl (who thinks some-guy is hot, in case it wasn't mentioned enough in the book) wants to indulge in hot some-guy's fantasies. Also the hot some-guy takes complete control over girl (did I mention she thinks he's hot?) who seems to be totally okay with it. More stuff happens. Girl gets spanked too hard, breaks up with hot some-guy. The end.'That's it. That's the whole book. And the whole 'Ohhh Christian has secrets' bullcrap in the blurb? Bullcrap. His secrets are mentioned in only 5% of the book and drive the plot nowhere. The book is only about how some asshole wants to control some stupid girl. The other characters are barely relevant. They were just more props whose only role was to be interested in the 'relationship' between Ana and Christian. They didn't seem to be interested in anything else. They could be buttering toast and thinking 'I wonder how hard Christian is fucking Ana right now.'An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its' descendants. You know what they say, you can polish a turd, but it will still be a turd.",1
"857","10818853","I have finally made a decision about Fifty Shades of Grey. I know, I know, my review of this isn't really needed, everybody's talking about this book, everybody's got the general gist of what it's about. But I've spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I've been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately after finishing it and before I started (and finished) the other two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars, I expressed all that Fifty Shades of Grey had made me feel: annoyed, frustrated, confused, and also entertained. I have since then felt like I have much more to add.The reason I personally think that opinions differ so greatly on these novels is not because people have different sexual tastes. For some, yeah, this will come into play. However, I think the main reason is that this book and the characters send out a confusing mix of messages. When I finished Fifty Shades of Grey, I had no idea what kind of book I'd just read. Was it BDSM erotica? Or the tale of a man's childhood abuse and how this impacted on his sex life later on? Were Christian Grey's sexual tastes supposed to be erotic or wrong? Let me tell those of you who haven't read this: it isn't clear.This book appears to be an erotic BDSM romance at face value. But Ana makes it clear early on that she doesn't want that kind of relationship, that Christian is ""fifty shades of fucked up"", that the way he behaves isn't right, but is actually the result of an abusive upbringing. Ana later contradicts her early decision and gets all pouty when Christian won't play kinky with her... and yet the previous time he'd done it she spent the evening crying and feeling sorry for herself. Some people seem to see Christian as the big bad man who abuses a weak young woman. This is not the case. There is nothing, I repeat nothing, that happens between the two of them that Ana doesn't give consent to. Sure, she may whine about it afterwards, or use the excuse that she doesn't want to lose him, but she makes the choices, she holds the power.Here's what I think is the ultimate problem with Fifty Shades of Grey: Ms James' terrible writing. It's nothing new, she even admitted it herself, but that is why we all can't figure out what it is about this book that makes it some parts entertaining, some parts annoying as fuck. Because I'm trying to categorise this so I can begin to understand it, so that I can form my opinion and write my review accordingly. But we cannot understand what doesn't make sense. And James' characterisation does not make any sense at all. She writes Ana as a naive student at the mercy of Christian's abusive past, then she writes Ana as a sexual manipulator who actually likes BDSM. Is Christian sexy or a victim? I'll tell you: he's both and neither, because James cannot create characters and relationships to save her life. She contradicts herself, she changes her mind without logical reason. This is why it is pointless analysing the relationship between Ana and Christian. One minute it's sexy, the next minute it's fucked up. One minute it's BDSM, the next minute it's abuse. How do you accurately review a book that changes its mind every two minutes?I also feel I need to say something about BDSM. Any more than a small amount of kinky doesn't really interest me, but it doesn't bother me either if it is between consenting adults. However, there are two things I can say about this matter in Fifty Shades of Grey: 1) it really isn't that kinky, and 2) for the most part, this isn't really a BDSM relationship (I don't think the author actually understands what one is). I can't say that I'm experienced in visiting those kind of clubs down the dark allies of Soho, but I've done not a small amount of reading on the psychological aspect of BDSM relationships. I have a keen interest in feminism and I have often wondered if something like this is nothing but a hindrance to the progress of women and equality. I would conclude from my reading that it is not. Firstly, BDSM relationships are about give and take. The dom and the sub each give one another what they want/need. It isn't about abuse, it isn't about selfishly taking what you want, and because these relationships involve relinquishing control to another person, there is a deep amount of trust required. Also, it is important to note that the power of the dom is an illusion, the sub holds all the power, they say how far it goes, when it stops, what is too much. The key thing is that both of them get something out of it. Which is why the relationship in Fifty Shades of Grey can only be called BDSM when Ana does an abrupt u-turn on her opinions and decides she wants a bit of spankiness. The parts where she is upset about the relationship Christian wants - that is not BDSM. The parts where she reluctantly allows him to get his way - that is not BDSM. I think there is nothing wrong with BDSM erotica. I think there is nothing wrong with doms, subs, sex slaves, whatever... if that is what the person wants. But Fifty Shades of Grey is about 10% BDSM relationship and 90% bad writing that just fucks with your head until you're not sure what the hell you're reading. Ms James has created one mess of a book, whether you'll look at her mess and see something entertaining or horrific, well that's kinda just like looking at this picture and asking whether you see a rabbit or a duck.",2
"858","10818853","Head's up: If any of you fuckers comment at the bottom of this review and say, ""You don't understand BDSM"" I will hunt you down and make you eat your computer, plus the mouse, plus the keyboard, plus any other internet-connected devices in your home, including but not limited to iPhones, iPods, iPads, Androids, games consoles and ereaders. This book is not an accurate or healthy portrayal of a real BDSM relationship between two consensual and enthusiastic parties. Thus, by defending it as such, you are doing a disservice to the actual culture of BDSM (no kinkshaming). So don't fuck with me and try to pull that shit.Oh, also, there will be a substantial amount of cussing throughout this review. If you care about the sanctity of your virgin eyes then shut down your computer and go do something else. We are all grown-ass adults and this is the internet. If you're going to come over and here and lecture me about swearing then I'd advise that you PIPE the fuck down and stop being so bloody delicate. Alrighty, then. You guessed it, guys: it's story time.When I was thirteen, I decided I wanted to be an author. For years I'd chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you, but who was I kidding? All I ever wanted to do was write. So I sat down, and I did. I did write.I'm actually not shitting you. I thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on Wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and I wrote a lot of crap: I tried to write a play, and then I tried poetry, and then I wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. Novels is a stretch. I wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. And they actually did. Remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? Or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? I feel the same level of shame when I think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking I actually had something.About a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, I posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher's slushpiles. A vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn't want my work, and I did the undoable: I argued with them.As I write this, I'm practically convulsing with embarrassment. Vanity Publisher, if you're reading this, please forget I ever existed. But if you can't do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research.In some ways, having read this book, I finally feel like I identify with that vanity publisher: I read someone's irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and I got so mad I broke a window with my face.(Peeps, if you think E.L. James hasn't tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on YouTube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.)I just...I haven't read a book this awful since Revealing Eden (but let's not open that can of worms). It was like an acid trip. Am I reading this, I thought? Is this actually a published book? Are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage?I feel like this book insulted me, really. I feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? It's as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved Ana of her brain. How could you...? Why would you...? Why is she...?I just...I have no words. I have no words to explain this protagonist. None at all. I have more to say about the love interest, who's like a more threatening Charles Manson but with only one brainwashed follower (Ana). This guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and Ana doesn't think this is weird?What the fucking fuck?And of course there's the whole ""inner goddess"" shit and Ana thinking that it's sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word ""vagina"" during a sex scene. ""Oh, he touched my vagina"".Yeah, excuse me while I tame my boner!I felt so uncomfortable reading this book. Now, let's be honest here: I read porn. Of course I read porn. Anyone over sixteen who says they've never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. But this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here's the kicker: I read it alone. I was reading it alone in my living room, and I felt uncomfortable inside my own head. What the fuck does that tell you?I don't want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. It's written like horrendous fanfiction. There are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and I don't know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had.What are the redeeming features? I don't know. The blurb sounds interesting. That's about it.But what is it about this book that's captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? The absurdly stupid protagonist? The pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? The relationship in which only one party is actually interested in BDSM, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? The terrible writing? The awful cover art? The cheap, thin binding? A story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from Twilight?There is nothing enjoyable about this book. This book is garbage. There are no two ways about it: it is shit. Awful, awful shit. And I'm not sorry for saying so. This is my fucking opinion, and I'm damn well going to voice it. This book can kiss my ass.",1

Review edited February 12, 2015“Sex is more than an act of pleasure, it's the ability to be able to feel so close to a person, so connected, so comfortable that it's almost breathtaking to the point you feel you can’t take it. And at this moment you're a part of them.  - Author unknown -  I've had a rather long list of issues when I decided to abandon ship. FSoShit is garbage and if I had read a paperback I would have burned the fucking offending thing. It's a total mystery to me why this book ever saw the light of day because, let's face it, the writing is incredibly juvenile. The story and characters are extremely poorly written and I couldn't for the life of me connect with the dumb, clumsy, naïve and immature heroine. Also, the slimy whacko didn't deserve to be called hero. Christian is a highly manipulative, abusive and stalker-ish asshole. His whispers didn't endear him to me either. He came off as a total creep. I honestly don't understand what Ana saw in him, yet on the other hand, I didn't get it why Christian would stalk that bland and vapid wallflower. In any event, these two deserved each other and Ana obviously enjoyed Grey's blunt and crude approach.The whole contract business was pretty much mind-boggling. I don't believe that a healthy and consensual Dom/sub relationship could be based upon such crappy and ridiculous rules.Christian, the rich Superman (sarcasm), deflowered our wallflower in a way that's not even worthy of losing any words over that pathetic fuck. So, you did guess right. I neither found the sex to be hot nor erotic. At.All. Thus, I'd better buy him a ticket to the next Mars expedition stat. That would ensure that Mr. Grey would not return to our cozy place called Mother Earth.FSoG lacked depth and emotion big time. Except of disgust and anger I felt nothing towards these pathetic main protagonists and their fucked up trip bored me to tears.The winking smileys irritated the hell outta me and all that inner goddess shit made me almost blow a fuse. Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Would you give me a break already? I've read a variety of erotica books and I do enjoy great smexin' that comes with some kind of depth and great characterization. However, I'm not sorry to say that FSoG is ranking among the worst erotica books I've ever read.What's seriously bugging me as well is the fact that the general public thinks that FSoShit provides almost every woman's erotic fantasy. I don't criticize readers who loved this book but I'm criticizing the media coverage. I don't appreciate it when these people claim to know that's what a general majority of women love to read and want in real life (or in the bedroom for that matter). Seriously? Never. Ever. FSoG is bad erotica. It's bad BDSM too. When people say FSoG is “empowering women in their sexuality,” then I think something is seriously wrong. Never ever could this story empower me in my sexuality. What in God’s name is on their minds? I can do it all by myself with my very healthy hand, and I can gladly say that my boyfriend is empowering me just fine and is taking care of my needs. Thank you very much. BTW, my boyfriend is not an abusive and manipulative stalker. Oh, yes, now it dawns on me…my boyfriend is real.Bottom line, the barely there plot and the characters were overly shallow, underdeveloped, immature and boring. The amateurish writing killed any desire to read anything else by this author in the future. And last but not least, my inner goddess was so fucking relieved when she had to quit eventually. It was a very tedious and crappy experience and I wish I had never bought this book, let alone attempted to go through this rubbish. I was in dire need of bleaching my brain.Christopher Hitchens said…

"860","10818853","I didn’t want to start this book. Many people are praising it but I’m simply not into erotica, it's just not my vibe. But this book got way too famous so I guess I'm too curious for my own good.Christian Grey. A hot dude that melts a woman’s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters in romance. Really? This guy?Anastasia is an immature insecure desperate idiot who wants to become a true woman. She just wants to listen to her inner goddess (?!) and have hot monkey sex with Grey. She has no personality nor will whatsoever, she gets excited over the smallest and most idiotic things you can imagine and even though she sees how wrong Grey is, she still goes for it. Gurl, your inner goddess should work on giving better advice. She’s always mooning over Grey like he’s some kind of god that she’s supposed to worship. He tells her that he doesn’t want a serious relationship just sex and she’s still ok with it. Why? Just because he’s hot. And rich. He hurt her the first time they made love, she was a virgin of course (and I don’t buy the crap with it being perfect, surely she surely got hurt after that), and is treating her like a slave. Even though he’s a successful businessman and he’s rich and famous he still can be a psychopath. Just watch American Psycho and you’ll know what I’m talking about.Now: THE CONTRACT. Signing paperwork in order to have sex with him? Is he a natural hazard or what? I get the whole Hey look at me I’m badass, I have my own company and helicopter gig ‘cause the guy is stinking rich but a contract??? I guess a suit can't help the instinct, must have paperwork for everything.
   “Why would I do that?”“To please me”
All women want to please him. Of course. Because he's so hot and rich. And a complete beast in bed. Of course.
  “I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don’t, I shall punish you, and you will learn,”

  “It’s about gaining your trust and your respect, so you’ll let me exert my will over you.”
Meanwhile everyone else:Question for all the people who loved this book. If Grey wasn’t so hot would you have still enjoyed it as much?",1

"862","10818853","I read this book back before E.L. James even wrote it. I don't brag about a lot of things, but my review skills are one of the few things I will brag about.E.L. James read my review on this book and she loved it SO much, she decided to go ahead and write the book. Here is a word-for-word copy of our email exchange from that day. ***E.L. James: Hello, Colleen Hoover! I saw your book review on Fifty Shades of Grey and I loved it so much, I decided I would write the book. I'm already finished writing chapter twelve. I just wanted to say thank you. Without your review, I would never have found the inspiration for this book. Colleen Hoover: You're so welcome. I'm great at this reviewing thing, right? E.L. James: You are. Take care. Colleen Hoover: Laters, Baby. E.L. James: That's brilliant! I might put that in my book if you don't mind! Colleen Hoover: If you do, don't give me credit for it. I don't like attention. I get SO much already. Someday when you finish this book, you'll know what it's like.***A few months following the above email exchange, Fifty Shades of Grey released and E.L.

"866","10818853","OOOOHHH the movie opens TODAY!! now, i'm not likely to ever see the movie, but i will say it's pretty ballsy to cast the romantic lead - a character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment - with the actor that many people only know as the character who ties up ladies for erotic enjoyment ... and then kills them.************************************now hear me out, people. i liked it, but i didn't like it-like it. the writing is shitty, it is, but i am a sucker for enthusiasm. and you can tell she has it. at the reading of hers i worked, she didn't come across as some fame-hungry monster -she seems as baffled by her success as i am. it's like people with ugly kids. they know what they have brought into the world, but they love it regardless, and they're just happy when the other kids play with it on the playground. and it's not that i think she's ashamed of it, she probably thinks it is quite good, but she knows it isn't high lit or anything. and yeah, it started out as fanfiction, but i was informed rather tartly last night that she always intended to publish it and was just using the fanfic community for feedback, so any grace i was going to give to her on the grounds that ""this was intended as a tribute not initially intended for publication and so we can't judge it on the same grounds"" has been undermined. but i will keep it at three stars, because it was okay, for what it was. i rolled my eyes a lot while reading this (and in terms of this book's rules, my ass would have been so sore) but there was something about the author's dopey-puppy earnestness that i found endearing. so, final verdict: not terrible,(okay, a little terrible) but not worthy of a ny times bestseller when there are so many genuinely good books out there. onto... the sex and those of you with a knee-jerk reaction to bdsm - because i have seen comments on threads for this review that this book is about rape and beatings etc. etc. - just know that this is very hot topic bdsm - by which i mean the subculture fashion store at suburban malls, not that it is very topical and jodi picoult will write a book about it. although she probably will, now, now that all the ladies are reading this and wanting to spice up their bedroom lives with their schlubby husbands.i myself am not into the lifestyle, but as far as people i know who are, i know wayyy more female doms than male doms. let's face it, female doms have hotter clothing than female subs. and bdsm isn't about rape. it isn't about abuse. it is about trust, as dana so aptly put it last night (she is also not part of that scene. to my knowledge) but it is an arrangement. it is an understanding. there are safewords and precautions and for some people, that's just the way they are wired: top, bottom, straight, gay, dom, sub... and i hate it when people get all high-handed on the internets about kinks they don't understand. ""i got an open mind so why don't you all get inside"" but as far as this book goes, this is the most vanilla bdsm i have ever read. she's a virgin when they meet, and he is respectful of that, which was one of the better scenes in the book. but like any relationship in this fetish, they work out the details beforehand and determine their boundaries. and honestly, she is a shitty, shitty sub; she says ""no"" to a bunch of things that even i have done and i am not even kinky. and he isn't interested in things that many typical bdsm relationships would include, which ditto for that. (by which i mean i have looked a man in the eye - you don't need to know my life.) so it's very tame. if disney were going to make a bdsm movie, they would use the same contract. because real suspension?? it looks more like this: 
   or this:
   or this:
   what they do is what teenagers do when they are still in their experimentation stage. okay - so that's out of the way - this is bondage-lite. moving on to the rest of it, because this had a lot fewer scenes of erotic journeying than i had feared. there are still plenty, but the first scene isn't until after page 100, and after that, it isn't taking over the whole book. but there's still enough for you people who aren't reading this for the articles. twilightthere is a lot of debate about whether this reads like twilight, because it started out as twilight fanfic. some people say ""yes"" some people say ""nooo."" i am here to break that tie. OF COURSE IT READS LIKE TWILIGHT!!! are you mad?? ALL the twilightisms are there: the ""i'm bad for you"" speeches, the emphasis on smells, the ineffable attraction of a perfect and wealthy man to an underdescribed, clumsy and tongue-tied female who is all ""who, me??"" with all of the self-doubt and self-esteem issues, all the ""how can such a perfect specimen fall for li'l ole me??"", the seeecrets and the endless endless repetitions.and those repetitions make the book so frequently annoying.but that's not her fault, not if that is what she is going for. it's actually quite remarkable that she was able to mimic meyer's style to that extent. sure, it's irritating as hell, but as an homage, it's quite accomplished.i have decided to interpret her linguistic quirks as homage, not as weak writing. feel free to disagree - it's just my take on it. (although the writing is frequently weak in other areas as well. i am just feeling generous.) languagefirst of all, e.l. james is british. and yet - because this is twilight fanfic, she had to set it in washington state. but no one told her how we talk. pssst - we use our present perfect tense differently than you do. yes, even those of us who are/were lit majors. when americans say things like ""i've not been there"" etc, it sounds pompous. sorry to you americans who do talk like that, but it does. it sounds affected. especially in erotic fiction set in washington state. miscellaneousthere are so many gasps in here, it may as well have been titled the great gaspy. i personally have never heard a man gasp with lust in response to something i have said. how do i do this? does he have a breathing disorder? why are his eyes always darkening? i have never noticed this phenomenon, but it is a staple of romance novels. i was not aware this could actually happen. biting of the lips, linen, inner goddess, subconscious, medulla oblongata, blushing, control freak... get used to these words. there are at least 50 occurrences of these words on every page. charactersi do not understand his attraction to our heroine. she never says anything interesting, except in her emails. those emails are the best part of this book. she shows more personality there than in any conversation, and that's just odd, to me. i'm not sure why i was expecting much more from a character whose favorite book is tess, because you know how i feel about that book, but i was glad to see thomas hardy pop up frequently, even if it is my least favorite of his books. and christian is also unstable and mercurial and full of anger towards peccadilloes. and - god - his food issues. even without his sexual needs, this guy is a piece of work. i'm not sure i could put up with someone so changeable, even if he was an uncommonly gorgeous billionaire who wanted to buy me old and expensive books... gotta draw the line somewhere.plus, once i saw the leather bed, i'd be outta there. that's just gross, all sticky and germ-encouraging. i don't know - i wanted to write a much better review for this book - there was so much i wanted to say, but i am feeling lazy right now. i feel weird giving it three stars, because there was so much about this book i didn't like, but the three-stars here is more of a ""i thought it was going to be so much worse than it is"" and my deeply charitable heart which overlooks weaknesses in favor of an author's zeal. but here, enjoy this link of gilbert gottfried reading this book aloud:http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/677...and here are three other options, if you'd rather giggle: fifty shades of grey pussy catsa coupla shades of taupefifty shames of earl greycome to my blog![""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",3
"867","10818853","I only bought this on Kindle because I was curious to see whether a professional edit made it any better than the original fanfic (which I abandoned once I realized the plot wasn't original enough for me to suffer through the cut-rate writing). Paging through this ""published"" version makes me more embarrassed for the author than I was when it was in the fanfic domain, and it DEFINITELY made me lose respect for The Writer's Coffee Shop.Most distracting is the schizophrenic voice of the main character, Ana. In one paragraph, Ana's words sound like those of a quasi-literate teenager; in the next paragraph she uses uber-literate words like ""gamine"". Are we supposed to believe that she's naive or sophisticated? Un-self-aware or articulate?Add in culture confusion: Ana is supposed to be American, but the author (who is from the U.K.) keeps having Ana use Britishisms! Her roommate isn't ""sick"" like American people are, she's ""ill""; Ana doesn't ""grab her bag"" before going out the door, she ""gathers her satchel"". Ana's voice fails to consistently ring true for an American girl.Yet, the worst literary crime is the outright misuse of language. Says Ana at one point: ""The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor."" Um...terminal velocity occurs when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag, and it can't be reached by a controlled-speed mechanism that draws an object upward (such as an elevator). Even if the author didn't know this, the editor should have caught it.The problems don't end there. From cliches (without a lick of irony or humor, Ana is described as putting the ""pedal to the metal"" as she drives), to awkward sentences, to nonsensical metaphors, this work is amateurish. There's nothing wrong with being an amateur, but there IS something wrong with charging people money for something that hasn't been professionally edited. If this author wants to be taken seriously, she should take the time to learn about writing craft and align herself with an editing house that will turn her writing into serious work.",1
"868","10818853","ONE HUNDRED BILLION NEGATIVE STARS
  Well, I think it’s safe to say that I’m buying myself a chastity belt and am joining a nunnery. This book has put me off sex for ever and ever.I know I said I was never going to touch this with a ten-foot pole, but then this happened:
  Basically, my co-blogger dared me to read the books after a joke about the author, or I was never allowed to diss the books again.… the joke wasn’t worth it.This piece of shit, this sorry excuse for a book is without a doubt the worst piece of literature fanfiction I have ever read. I have never suffered so much in my life. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Normally I’d add a short summary of the plot, but there is no fucking plot. Boy meets girl, boy is a fucking psychopath, girl does as she’s told, lots of sex, lots of whining. The parts that didn’t have sex bored me out of my goddamn mind, and the parts that did have sex were so absurd and revolting that I couldn’t go on reading without raging on Goodreads about it.I seriously cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is a bestseller. That women all over the world adore this book, and adore Christian Grey. The man is an abusive stalker and the fact that women are fantasising about this fuckwit sets our society back about 500 years. Thanks for that, wankers.Reasons why you should run away from Christian Grey and possibly shoot and castrate himOh boy, where do I start?
  * He tracks her fucking phone. Strike one.
""How did you find me?""""I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.""Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is that legal? Stalker, my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that's still floating in my brain, but somehow, because it's him, I don't mind.
Because it’s not stalking if the guy is hot!* “Well, if you were mine, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.�� Strike two.* “You should steer clear from me.” Strike three, and he should be out. Go home, thank you for playing.But the list goes on.* Christian’s endless commanding and controlling Anastasia. “Sit.” “Come.” “Eat.” Like she’s a fucking dog. Worst of all, Anastasia would happily wag her tail and roll over for him.* More stalker tendencies: he knows where she lives without her telling him. When Kate and Ana move house to Seattle, he again knows where she lives without her telling him. And then, when Ana flies to Georgia to escape, not only does he know where her mother lives, he also knows her mother’s last name, knows which flight Ana is on, and follows her to Georgia. Without her permission. And he happens to stay in the hotel she’s having dinner at. Fucking hell. If that’s not an alarm bell, I don’t know what is. This guy is fucking insane.* Bipolar tendencies. One moment, he’s all nice, the next, he becomes dark and cold. Just the mere mention of another guy gets him angry. He becomes all moody when there’s another male presence around Ana. It’s sickening.* He gets a thrill out of how young Ana looks with pigtails.* Not only does he tell her when to eat, he also orders her drinks and food for her, without taking into account what she wants.
  “Is this what our err… relationship will be like?” I whisper. “You, ordering me around?”“Yes,” he murmurs.
The BDSM contract is the perfect example of this:
  “The Submissive will ensure she achieves a minimum of seven hours sleep a night when she is not with the Dominant.”“The Submissive will not snack between meals, with the exception of fruit.”“During the term, the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the Dominant.”“The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions.”""The Submissive shall accept whippings, floggings, spankings, caning, paddling or any other discipline the Dominant should decide to administer, without hesitation, enquiry or complaint.”“The Submissive shall not touch or pleasure herself sexually without permission from the Dominant.”“The Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do without hesitation or argument.”“The Submissive shall not look directly into the eyes of the Dominant except when specifically instructed to do so.”
Not only that, but you will undergo any beauty treatment I tell you, wax whenever and wherever I tell you, and be available every weekend. I really hope I don’t need to explain how sick this is.* The guy is an absolute control freak. 
   ""You've not eaten very much.""""I've had enough."" “Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you’ve not eaten all day.”
He’s keeping a fucking inventory of the things she eats. He also keeps track of how many orgasms he’s given her. And he gets angry when Ana decides to go away for a bit, even if it’s just to visit her mother. “Palm-twitchingly mad.”* He doesn’t give two shits about what Ana wants. Ana has mentioned a dozen times about how she doesn’t want Christian to buy her things. So he buys her 14,000-dollar-worth old books, a Macbook, a Blackberry, and a fucking car.* He’s obviously a creep. He gives her grades like she’s a bloody school girl. Worst of all – she’s proud of it too.
  “Swallowing semen… well, you get an A in that.”I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together with glowing pride.

  Just.. yikes.He also says he’d “pay good money” to see her consult with a gynaecologist. What the fuck is wrong with you?!And he has rape tendencies:
  “No one’s ever said no to me before. And it’s so – hot.”
* He doesn’t like it when she asks personal questions, yet has no qualms with invading her privacy three times over.* He wants to own Ana. He wants her to be his possession. Like she’s a fucking car.Even more alarm bells:1.	“You scare me when you’re angry.”2.	He spanks her so hard that she can’t sit down from the pain. “Holy fuck it hurts.”3.	About the spanking: “During the whole alarming process I felt demeaned, debased and abused.”4.	To which he replies: “I am tempted to drive back over there to ensure that you don’t sit down for a week, rather than an evening.”5.	Ana never cries, until she meets Christian. Suddenly, she cries all the time.6.	“Take some Advil – this is not a request. And don’t drive your Beetle. I will know.”7.	“If I listened to my body, I’d be in Alaska by now.”“Alaska is very cold and no place to run. I would find you. I can track your cell phone – remember?”8.	“Will he ever give me a break? He is suffocating me.”9.	“He’d probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me.”10.	“Holy cow. He wants to hurt me… how do I deal with this? I can’t hide the horror on my face.”
  Right, I think there are enough examples here. This is beyond fucked up.On to the writing. It was horrible. Every single word was overused. I am going to shoot someone if I ever have to hear “oh my” or “holy cow” again. If I have to read one more mention about how she bites her lip, or how s/he gasps, or how their breaths hitch. Worst of all – “down there”.
  You’re already being racy by writing BDSM. At least use proper terms. Vagina. Pussy. Vulva. Lady bottom. Muff. Vajayjay. Hoo-ha. Bojingo. Box. Cave. Clam. Flower. Coin purse. Cooch. Cunt. Twat. Dragon's lair. Slot machine. Taco. Fanny. Beaver. Gash. Honey pot. Sausage wallet. Venus fly trap. ANYTHING.The subconscious/inner goddess shit annoyed me to no end.
  “ I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.”“My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.”“My inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms.”“My inner goddess is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast.”

  It was like the author was desperately trying to make Anastasia sound intelligent, especially when she used terms such as “medulla oblongata”. When we all know she’s a dumb cunt, because she signs contracts without reading them. The fact that she keeps running back to Christian also signifies that she has an IQ of a garden gnome.There was also the constant need to remind us that Christian Grey is good-looking. Seriously, every time she saw him there was mention of how hot he was, and every time she thought of him, as well. “Adonis”, “Michelangelo’s David has nothing on him”, someone pass me a bucket.Then there are the inaccuracies. Anastasia has to be some kind of Superwoman. No hangover after drinking tequila for the first time. She’s never been drunk in her life, yet she can wolf down a massive breakfast easily the next morning. Then, when her virginity is absolutely destroyed by Christian (literally – “he slams into me” / “as he rips through my virginity”), she comes twice and is happy to do it again right away. She has no pain whatsoever. She’s also perfectly able to take it doggy style after just losing her virginity, because why the fuck not.On top of that, she's instantly exceptional at everything. Must be great, to be a natural. No awkwardness whatsoever.At one point, she gasps and swallows at the same time. I tried to do it. I don’t think it’s possible.Things that I think were supposed to be sexy but really weren’t“The walls and ceiling are a deep, dark burgundy, giving a womb-like effect to the spacious room.”“Two orgasms… coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.”“He slowly inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it round and round, stroking the front wall of my vagina.” After which he sticks his bloody thumb in her mouth.“I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He’s my very own Christian Grey flavour popsicle.” Not only is that disgusting, but I find it hard to believe that she thinks giving blowjobs is a turn-on. I find nothing sexy about testing my gag reflex repeatedly.As if Christian read my mind, he goes, “Don’t you have a gag reflex?” Words every girl wants to hear.“My heated blood pools low in my belly.” Is she on her period?“Stop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I don’t care who gets in with us.” Whoa there, cowboy.“I’d really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.” What, you’re going to put a flag up there?The tampon scene.
  Things I learned from Fifty Shades of Grey:* If your future mother-in-law practically catches you having sex with her son, don’t worry – she’ll be delighted to meet you, because it means her son is not gay.* Find someone who’s willing to be your Dominant. That way, you never have to make any decisions again! He’ll decide what and when you eat and drink, when and how long you sleep, what you wear, what you drive, when you exercise… easy!* Your first time will not be painful, even if you’ve never masturbated before. Not even if he slams into you! You won’t feel a thing. In fact, you’ll like it and you’ll come twice. Then you’ll want to do it again straight away!* You look plain. That’s okay. You’ll still have three hot guys fighting over you.* When a girl you barely know is drunk, it’s probably a good idea to take her back to your place, take off her trousers, and sleep in the same bed as her.* You can’t get pregnant when you’re on your period. (Honestly, I’m surprised this fuckwit hasn’t knocked anyone up before Ana)
  Christian Grey, I hope you get a blowjob by a motherfucking shark. You sick son-of-a-bitch.That is all.",1
"869","10818853","I feel like there is a deeper meaning behind Fifty Shades of Grey then just BDSM and sex but the huge downfall of this book was the writing. I can see both sides of the fifty shades argument. There are points in the book where I can see abuse but there are also points where there is none. I just hate the fact that if people enjoy this book they are labeled as ""pro-rape advocates"" or ""pro-abuse"". STOP IT. Stop trying to belittle others, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. You may not agree but don't hate, we are all readers here!",2
"870","10818853","Post Script on May 8, 2012This book has exploded since I first read it and it seems to be one that is either loved or hated. I'm actually very thankful that I read it before any of my GR friends or anyone I knew, because I feel like if I read it now, after hearing all the hype, it would probably disappoint.People have very strong reactions to Fifty Shades and just to put in my two cents: you read different books for different reasons. In my opinion!!! ...: Was this book a great piece of literature? No. Were these characters ones whom you could write grad school theses about? No. But you know what? I loved the romance, I loved the chemistry, and I enjoyed myself tremendously while reading it - it had me grinning ridiculously for hours. That's what I wanted from this book, and that's what I got, so for me, that was enough.Post Post Script on October 9, 2012I greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book. For those making hateful comments: you don't like the book, people who did are apparently driving you crazy, so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews!! Age-old rule: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.Post Post Post Script on January 13, 2017Almost 500 comments on this review, but none for awhile, so not sure why I'm coming back to it now. I started reading the most recent comments though and my own review, and frankly I wanted to delete some of it, but figured that was ridiculous at this point. I wouldn't write this same review were I to read it now, but that was what I thought that morning at the time right after I read it, so it is what it is. Finally watched the movie recently, which is probably what brought me round to this, and for the record: yes, Christian does f*cked up shit (they don't even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life, I would have advised her to get a restraining order, because wtf. But it's not. Anyway. I wrote what I wrote; I was in my early 20s; I liked it. Peace xoSincerely, Juliana
  * Actual Review Begins Here *

  5+ stars.
 Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I still feel somewhat under the spell of this book. I'm so ... beguiled by it ;-) (book allusion). It was honestly an amazing read - and one which I meant to just skim a few sample pages of, but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish. I wasn't even sure I wanted to write a review, because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice.This ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances I have read. In some ways, I feel conflicted like Anastasia when I say that: my instinct is to say that can't be, because of what their relationship revolves around / how it's constructed ... but somehow it can be and it's true. Anastasia, Christian, and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel. Even though its counterintuitive, I can't help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful, complex, and emotional ones I've read in the romance genre.It's one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books I read and knock down their ratings half a star, because when put on the same scale they don't compare. I had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing, both because I was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor. I had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as I read, but I was also extremely nervous, because real BDSM sub/dom books are not my thing, and so while I was falling increasingly in love with Ana and Christian with every new page I read, I was also terrified that I was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top BDSM scene. Thankfully, that never happened, and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end.{ Not What I Expected }I'm not normally a BDSM book reader, but this was so, so, SO much more than just that. I don't think that I have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic. I write seemingly because I have no personal experience, so no idea, but to me it read that way. It was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes. Instead, it's woven throughout, showing us how it impacts and affects both characters. Ana and Christian remain Ana and Christian in those scenes, in the sense that it doesn't feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota. I'm not even sure I want to categorize this book as erotica, because that seems so limiting. (There was hot - intense - chemistry, don't get me wrong, and I definitely had some turn-the-AC-up moments).{ Loved our Heroine: Anastasia / Ana (21) }Anastasia was one of the best heroines, because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal! Not over-the-top for effect, but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes. She's a virgin, has no experience with men, and didn't know anything about BDSM, so of course she's going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it's ""right"" or it's ""wrong"" or if she even feels comfortable doing it. She also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with Christian and wants to be in a relationship with him. Ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy. Her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and I could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways, thinking those exact same things, and feeling those exact same conflicts.Ana is strong - she's somewhat shy and quiet, but like all real people, you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet, but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub Christian first thinks she might be. Ana examines her motivations and feelings when she's confused or unsure - not only about what she should do, but about what she wants to do and what Christian wants from her. The story is told in first-person, which is sometimes iffy for me, but it worked well here; Ana's tone as narrator is smart, self-aware, and immensely likable.{ Adored our Hero: Christian (27) }Christian is one of the best heroes. He's intense and dark and I know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this, but I actually found him to be so accessible. There are still things we need to know about his history, obviously - I have some guesses, but don't know anything for sure. Nonetheless, he also felt like the most authentic BDSM dom I could ever read because he's not just that - he's a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life, personality, and mannerisms, so that it's integral to his character, even when we see him around other characters who don't know about this part of his life.Christian is possessive, a little stalkerish, domineering (no duh), authoritarian, elusive, mercurial - all of those things and more. He is also one of the most tender, tortured, and sensitive heroes I've ever read. His despair and his need for Ana is his life are like living, breathing things and they jump off the page. He also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires, though he discovers and faces new things through Ana's questions and confrontations. He needs to dominate and control his partner, but he also needs Ana, so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that ""more,"" but ends up wanting it himself as well.{ An Unbelievable Connection and Relationship }From the first page of their encounter, the chemistry between Anastasia and Christian was off the charts. It was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense. Their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they're coming from such different places, you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together, trying to understand what the other wants, what they themselves want, etc. The dialogue, the emails, the EVERYTHING between them is 
  a m a z i n g
 !!! I had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book. This goes back to my first point, but I was just so amazed by how realistic their relationship seemed, despite the BDSM sub/dom factor, which to me seems so foreign. It was complex, difficult, lovely, distressing, uplifting, intense, hopeful.{ This Book Felt So Honest }And I mean this in multiple ways: the main characters, their relationship, and the subject matter. Reading this book feels like an intimate act, because Ana and Christian are truly laid bare for us; yes, there are still things about his past we don't know, but who they are, their essentials, are revealed to us. Their relationship is so honest, and I mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it. Within the book, I so, SO loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts, that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out, figure out what this is between them. Loved, loved, LOVED it! Also, for the reader how their connection is shown, both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very, very honest. It wasn't porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink's sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another.{ Overall Fantastic }Surprisingly funny and sweet! Fantastic secondary characters. No evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story. Subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension. Complex characters. Etc, etc.{ Ending of the Book / Series } (no spoilers)*Important to know that Ana and Christian's story does not end here.*The ending is jarring, though I had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book's summary (
  Fifty Shades Darker
, due out September 15). I think the buildup should definitely have been extended, because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me.As little a thing as it is, the fact that the end says ""End of Part One"" and this isn't viewed as Book 1 and the next as Book 2, really made a difference to me. Gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission. I love where the book / series titles come from, lol (Christian's remark to Ana that he's ""fifty shades of f*cked-up""). Note: All together, there will be three books.For those interested but unsure, Google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you'll like the book or not: http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wR7...

  My review for Fifty Shades Darker",NA
"871","10818853","Bad Book Is Like Other Bad Book ShockAt a standing-room-only press conference earlier today, top researchers from the world famous Goodreads Center for Bodice-Ripping, Bondage and Twilight Studies revealed that a bad book was quite a lot like another bad book.""When I saw the final results of the data analysis, a cold shiver went down my spine,"" said the Center's director. ""The chain of inference is long, and at first we weren't sure all the steps were watertight, but now we're confident enough to go public. Expressing it in layman's language, what we have here is basically that this bad book is similar to another bad book, which in turn closely resembles a third bad book. The implications are literally mind-blowing and we're still trying to understand them. Thank you.""In other news, E.L. James was briefly hospitalized after a pile of gold coins collapsed, partially burying her for several minutes. She suffered ""minor contusions and abrasions"" but was able to return home to her money-cave following a medical examination.",NA
"872","10818853","Let me start by saying.... Wow! Just Wow!!This book is 5+ stars for me!! It is my favorite kind of story. You know what I mean...just so intense that the characters get so far under your skin that you can't stand to be away from them for any length of time? Well, that was me while reading this book, I couldn't concentrate to get anything done :)There are a lot of reviews on this book, and obviously the majority love it, so I am simply going to explain some of the reasons that this story grabbed hold of my heart and wouldn't let go.First, I am a total sucker for the tortured hero and you would be hard pressed to find a hero more tortured that our own beloved Christian Grey. That said, the fact that he is a gazillionaire at age 27 is nothing to shake a stick at! Christian's intensity and focus is what really captured me in all this, I keep having to remind myself how old he is. The chemistry between Anastasia & Christian is just off the friggin' charts, I swear at times I could feel it coming right off the pages, from the moment she 'fell' into his office!! :)I really enjoyed the BDSM element, it wasn't necessarily heavy but intense, especially listening to Christian tell Ana that he WANTED to hurt her and why. When he said he had never had to explain it before and knew he wasn't explaining well just melted my heart. There is such a vulnerable, sweet boy underneath that gorgeous domineering man!Obviously you can tell I am completely smitten with Christian, but let me tell you a little bit about why I completely love Ana too. Even though she is an innocent, oh and I mean really innocent, I can't help but love her fire! Yes, just like the rest of the female population she has fallen completely under Christian's spell but she is not willing to just submit to his every whim - She's feisty but conflicted, I love the emotion!! Now, I could wax poetic about this book all day long but I will instead say if you haven't read this and you enjoy a read that will stay with you for days after you finish it then I cannot recommend this enough!! GO GET IT - RIGHT NOW!!! That's right, shouty capitals!! LOL - I myself finished this one and jumped right into Fifty Shades Darker because like I said, I can't get enough!! Soooo..... Laters baby!!",5
"873","10818853","Huh. Let's see how bad this book really is.*reads some quotes from others' statuses*This book is trash and I don't even want to finish the damn thing. The excerpts are enough. I will not be under the influence of this devilry! Not even for the snark! Not even to make fun of it! Not even!And after seeing this:And that has got to be the LEAST disgusting/creepy/nonsensical thing that slime bag has said. THE LEAST! No effing way. I'm only seventeen-going-on-eighteen. I have a future to look forward to. And I need brain cells for that. But you should watch this for the lolz.And this",NA
"874","10818853","Uh, wow. So this is IT?!! The book that the whole world is in utter fascination with?!! I think someone is laughing their way to the bank.First, here is a mini review of this book in two GIFs:About the plot:About the writing:Got that??OK, now more of my sordid thoughts on this MASTERPIECE (**cough, cough**):So I shamelessly caved and read this book after repeatedly swearing I never would, but the publicity and hype finally won me over. (I also got a free copy of the book, no way was I going to pay for this.) And while I now have a better understanding of the fascination, I still don’t get it. Sure, there were some hot sex scenes, and at times Grey and Ana were both likable characters. I eventually even understood their fascination with each other. And I liked them when they were away from the whole BDSM/punishment/discipline/control freaky shit. Grey even had the sexual stamina of ten horny rabbits put together! What’s not to like about that? (Dang, that man is always hard and ready!!) But so much of this book was utterly disturbing! It primarily focused on Grey trying to coerce and manipulate her into being what HE needed, despite how much it would hurt her. He claimed to care for her and was patient, but it always boiled down to his need to punish and inflict pain. Outwardly he came across as a suave, polished and sophisticated normal person, but inwardly he was one sick dude. There were times they really were a great couple, but only when they were in a ‘normal’ environment. When the BDSM environment was involved, I wasn’t a fan of either of them. Initially I couldn’t understand what the heck Grey saw in Ana. A clumsy, mousy naïve girl who face plants on the ground (TWICE!), and then pukes her drunken gut out.  (Uh right, what guy wouldn't get hot for a girl like that?)  His quick attachment to her had me baffled for nearly the first half of the book. If all he wanted was a submissive with no romantic ties, why chose her? By his own words he no problem finding consenting partners before. After Grey reveals his proclivities, I figured Ana would run for the hills if she had a brain in her head. Unfortunately, she is a naïve virgin with no experience to even compare him to, and the poor girl is so blinded by how “OMG, he’s so HOT!” So when she actually entertains his twisted notions and begins negotiating terms of hard and soft limits, I wanted to scream at her! How stupid and naïve are you girl?!! WTF?? WHY?? She was too trusting, too unaware, and he was painting one rosy ass picture of how wonderful his lifestyle would be for her. Sorry, but signing over your free will into a sexual contract where you WILL get hurt is just F’d up, especially when your gut feelings are constantly telling you to flee. I’ll give Grey bonus points for his honesty at being so upfront with Ana, but that doesn’t make what he is about any less of a predator. He was honest with her about not wanting a normal ‘hearts and flowers’ relationship. If she agreed, she would be his submissive and enter into TRAINING. All he has to do is brainwash her into believing she would actually prefer this life style over the normal one she dreamed of. (WTF??!) Another aspect I did not get was how Ana repeatedly accuses him of having commitment issues, but throughout the book it was her that had one foot in the relationship and the other foot well outside of the door. He on the hand was far more committed, albeit with a strict set of ‘rules’. Despite all the WTFery and the disturbing portrayal of a young woman being coerced into an unknown and unsafe world, I was fascinated with the overall story. Like watching a train wreck fascinated, and nothing to be proud of. I found myself wanting to read just one more chapter and then another. So yes, this book was hard to put down. It was also hard not to pitch it at the wall! I honestly thought I would not want to read about BDSM, but surprisingly that aspect didn't even bother me all that much until the end The hard spanking scene was just cruel, as intended, and beyond disturbing!!. If this was about two mutual consenting adults who fully understood what they were getting into, I might have even enjoyed it. But the constant coercion and manipulation killed the book for me. In the end this book really made me want to scrub myself clean with Christian's own go-to cure for all those bruising sore asses. (Oh, lovely!) Take some Advil. And rub on some Arnica cream to sooth ‘bruising, sprains and injuries’. The writing is another issue with this book. It wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared, but the euphemistic inner dialogue drove me nuts. The book often read like a comic book script, not a serious contemporary novel. All of the Oh, my! GASP! whoa! What?! Kabam! Pow Pow! (OK, not the last couple ones, but the rest are real!) were tiresome and over-done to death. Well…love it or hate it, this was one controversial and thought provoking book, just WAY too distributing for my personal taste. They say one man's trash is another man's treasure, and maybe in this case one woman's trashy mommy porn is another woman's hot treasured erotica.

"875","10818853","I was basically dared to read this, with the impeccable logic of 'How can you know it's that bad if you haven't had a chance to form your own opinion?'What I *should have* pointed out in response to the dare would be that I know perfectly well that syphilis is a nasty disease without having the need to go and experience it myself.Sometimes perfect retorts come too late, after several hours have been hopelessly wasted on reading this poorly written painfully plotted schmutz.Blergh.",1
"876","10818853","2.5 stars.I don't think I've ever read a book that's left me quite as bemused as this one has. The writing left a lot to be desired, the heroine didn't impress me at all and yet I find myself wanting to read the next in the series. After having a day to let this sink in I have to try and put my feelings succinctly into a review. How do I say this exactly......... Anastasia damn near killed me. There were just too many things about her that turned me off bigtime. I can understand how her vulnerability could make you warm to her, but it just made me frustrated more than anything.The attraction between Christian and Ana was intoxicating and I was invested in it for sure, but the way that Ana was written really let her down in my opinion. She was an innocent young woman with no sexual experience but her immaturity and childish demeanor really astounded me. At 21 surely she would have had a bit more understanding of the way the world works. The whole ""inner goddess vs subconscious"" thing was so ridiculous and referred to so many times that I literally wanted to beat my head open with my e-reader. And also - pigtails. PIGTAILS on a 21 year old are so not okay. I'm sorry but what??Her completely contradictory behaviour - wide eyed innocence and being totally petrified by Christian's sexual tastes but thinking it's hot at the same time. I validate her reasoning behind being nervous about it but honestly why go through with it? If that's the only way you're going to be able to have Christian - by signing up for something like that - then do it. But don't carry on about it for the entire book. You're either invested in him and the relationship or not at all. I'm sorry but I'm a realist. Another example of Ana's immaturity and contradictory behaviour is how she got so angry at Kate for trying to rile Christian up and stoke his jealousy but then Ana did the exact same thing herself on the next page when she got the massage in first class and told him all about it. The game playing did not warm me to her whatsoever. In my status updates and other comments I stated how I felt the writing was awful. I really did, at least in the first half. The first person POV didn't help matters either; the narrative was so stilted and had no flow. It read like, ""I did this and then this happened and I walked here and I made my bed"". The lack of structure was amateurish and painful and made me wonder if the book had been edited at all. So now that I've got that off my chest let's talk about what I did like. A gorgeous multi-millionaire that becomes almost obsessed with you and wants to keep you for his very own? Any girl's ultimate fantasy right? That aspect of this story is what got me hooked. The fact that Christian had a particular method and structure with his relationships also really drew me in. A dominant hero who finds himself in lust (and maybe even in love) with an innocent is quite fascinating to me and kept me reading. The BDSM didn't bother me at all perhaps until the very end when the shit hit the fan.And then miracle of miracles, Ana actually grew on me towards the latter part of the book. I found myself very emotionally involved especially in the last 30 or so pages and it was interesting the way the chips fell. That is why I intend to read the next book in the series where no doubt I will be huffing and puffing about Ana all over again. As an update..... I can't believe my review is getting so many likes 9 months after reading this book. I thought I should let y'all know that I haven't touched this trilogy since stumbling my way through this way back then.",2
"877","10818853","I love the Fifty Shades trilogy! I've read this book so many times and each time I enjoy it as much as the last. It's one of those books that doesn't really need a review. Christian Grey will always hold a special place in my heart and on my list of book boyfriends <3",5
"878","10818853","(This is clearly a joke, no offence intended to anyone mentioned. My thanks to Tumblr for all the gifs. If you know nothing about British politics, this may make this a bit difficult.)ORDER! ORDER! 50 Shades of Grey review by the leader of the opposition. Mr Ed Miliband! ""Ed Miliband Reviews 50 Shades of Grey (whilst Ceilidh hopes this doesn't result in her party membership being revoked!)""Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing us to have this emergency meeting in the House of Commons to discuss this incredibly important manner in a polite, democratic fashion. As many of you may know, the publishing house Vintage recently purchased the erotic romance series 50 Shades of Grey, written by E.L. James, for a seven figure sum, thus allowing her to benefit from the Chancellor's recent top rate tax cut. I'm sure he'll be delighted to take responsibility for that.This book, originally published online as Twilight fan-fiction, has angered many in the literary community, especially those who feel that the author exploited fandom and copyrighted material for her own personal gain. The people are angry, Mr Speaker, and since this complacent government won't take it upon themselves to listen to the will of the people, not the corporations, I decided to read the book myself to see what all the fuss was about. It was... enlightening.First of all, it's heinously written. It makes the NHS bill look like a Booker prize winner. I can't help but wonder if the author was being paid by the ellipses. The British author just cannot write authentic American dialogue to save herself. It doesn't matter how many times the heroine gets called 'baby', that won't hide the frequent British anachronisms that any half-decent editor could have fixed. I won't even get started on the cringe-worthy nature of the dialogue itself. These characters read like teenagers, or at least how a middle aged woman imagines teenagers speak, which is worrying given they're all supposed to be in their twenties, but not surprising given that this is Twilight fan-fiction. A brief side note for the less internet savvy Members of Parliament present today. Fan-fiction are stories written by fans of an original work. Sometimes they're based on movies, songs, or in this instances books. And sometimes they're based on real people, known as RPF. During my research I uncovered a significant amount of RPF relating to me and various people of political interest. What can I say? What has been seen cannot be unseen:Returning back to the matter in hand, the juvenile nature of the prose only serves to highlight just how ridiculous the content of the novel is. The characters are clearly Edward and Bella (don't ask me how I know this, I'm a Desperate Housewives fan so my taste in popular culture is suspect at best) with no editing or creative spin put on them to differentiate them from fan-fiction state to original fiction state. They're bland, predictable and entirely stupid. Mr Speaker, the so-called hero of this piece, Christian Grey, is nothing short of an abusive spouse, masquerading as a sexual dominant. He pushes Ana into a situation she has no real understanding of and never provides her with any real information on what she's been forced into. Once again, we're left with a nasty little man considered charming and desirable based solely on his looks, although I imagine his extreme wealth also has something to do with that. He's condescending, mean, classless, he stalks her and puts her in situations she clearly says she's uncomfortable with. How is it romantic or sexy to intimidate your girlfriend and have her constantly worry about upsetting you for fear of your twitchy palm? That's shocking, Mr Speaker! Shocking!The hastily developed romance is not romance and it's more embarrassingly hilarious than sexy. This author has absolutely no understanding of what a dominant/submissive relationship entails. Christian's abhorrent behaviour is excused as a normal part of BDSM and D/S relations, which stem from his childhood trauma. Because, of course, only messed up people would ever want to mix pain with pleasure. This cheap, lazy mis-characterisation of an issue the author clearly knows less about than her readers only does a disservice to romance readers, real D/S relationships, and women full stop. It's bad enough that our society is sex obsessed without ever really discussing it, but surely women deserve better porn than this? I know my shadow Chancellor agrees with me. It's not even that kinky! It's a sad sign of just how sexually conservative this world is when a little spanking is considered hardcore BDSM. Then again, the spanking in this book is rage inducing in how badly it gets D/S relations wrong. Threatening the heroine is not how it works! At one point in the novel, Christian says, and I quote, ""I could threaten you."" Mr Speaker, how is this acceptable? The author doesn't know what she's doing! The only time this could legitimately enters the realm of kink is when Christian yanks out Ana's tampon and proceeds to have sex with her while she's menstruating. Not my cup of tea, I must admit. However, the scene is so badly written, so immature in its 1st person narration of the scene from Ana's point of view, that the only natural reaction is to laugh, cry or enter a perpetual state of panda-faced bemusement: Now, I won't go into further details on that area here in the interests of parliamentary politeness, but rest assured that many more qualified people than I have discussed this matter at length. Maybe the Chancellor can help us out there again, yes? Lashed to the mast, yes, Mr Chancellor? Mr Speaker, nothing in this book rings true. It's lacking in tension, in strong characterisation, in decent prose, in readable dialogue, in consistency and in pacing. It's evident that this work is fan-fiction because it reads like fan-fiction, not only in content but in style. It reads like it was supposed to be read on a chapter-by-chapter basis the way fan-fiction is designed. There's no finesse to the text. I highly doubt its publishers, The Writer's Coffee Shop, bothered to properly edit it before churning out overpriced copies to be sold online. A simple search-and-replace on names seems to have been the maximum work done to the text, as evidenced by Dear Author's comparison between the book and the original fan-fiction, available on their site. Mr Speaker, I can't help but feel exasperated by this self satisfied smug complacency by James and TWCS.It's not hard to see why readers are angry. Not only because of the more than suspect background to the story's origins and subsequent publication as well as the author's own behaviour. Not only because of the 7 figure publishing deal, the placement on the New York Times Bestseller list, and the rumours of a movie adaptation, something that could rival The Room in terms of midnight showing hilarity. Not only because of the mainstream media's complete lack of understanding on issues of fandom, romance novels, erotica and women's sexuality. Not only all of that, Mr Speaker. Readers have the right to be angry because this book is just plain bad. There is so much wrong with this book that just one Miliband cannot express it:Mr Speaker, action must be taken, and I doubt it will come from this complacent Prime Minister. We need strong, informed and occasionally sarcastic action against this surge of pull-to-publish fan-fiction that threatens to fill the market. If not, we will find that we have dug ourselves into a hole that will be impossible to escape, as demonstrated by my shadow Chancellor:A hole where creative copyright is diluted time and time again for profit, bypassing the copyright laws the way the cabinet evades the tax laws, never technically illegal but still morally suspect. Mr Speaker, where will it end? 50 Shades of Grey fan-fiction already exists - surely the Inception of fan-fiction - and what's to stop someone from taking that, changing the names and submitting it to TWCS or Omnific for publication? The media's lack of understanding of fandom can only hinder the discussions we truly need on this matter, so let us demand them and let us demand action!But the question is, will anything ever truly be done? Mr Speaker, I am sad to say that I doubt it will. Profit before creativity, money before ideas. The same old story from the same old Tories... I mean industry. Same difference. We await further developments of this case eagerly. Now, this is the first book in a trilogy, one that ends on a highly predictable cliffhanger, and I've been asked if I will read the other two. My answer is a short one:Mr Speaker I yield the floor. I'm going to go look for that fan-fiction where I'm a vampire and I get to feed on bankers!",1

I don't want to look at this fucking book. Everything about this book is fucking annoying and disgusting and I hate it. Brb bleaching my m eyes. What a fucking piece of shit book.",1
"880","10818853","This was like reading a jackhammer.This was like if Hannah Montana tried to write an erotica novel.The popularity of this book makes me need to move to a different planet. I am making the assumption that it comes from people not actually liking to read, but liking to have their self-destructive cultural values reinforced. Girls don’t like to eat. If you do whatever he says, he’ll turn into a handsome prince. It’s not his fault he’s abusing you, it’s only because mommy was mean. To have good sex, a girl has to start out not wanting it. Women have to teach men how to be human.If that’s not what it is, then maybe this book is an outline of a fairy tale and the sex scenes are what people are really looking at. Poor girl is asleep; rich prince is an asshole; they kiss and it wakes her up and turns him nice. We’re so used to the story that we don't need to hear any actual story again, but a shorthand is enough to awaken all of the comforting memories of being taught that if we stay with our abuser, he will change. It’s like this Jack Handy Deep Thought: “I remember the first time I ever saw a shooting star I said, ‘What the hell is that?’ But nowadays when I see one I just say, ‘What is that?’ I leave off the ‘hell’ part. Maybe when I'm old I'll just say, ‘Whazzit?’” Fifty Shades of Grey is the “Whazzit?” in a long line of stories about girls learning to be brainless to please their abusers.So, maybe the Whazzit story has become so common that it is a neutral color and a reader who enjoyed this book would really be focusing on the sex scenes. But, then, is the sex really worth focusing on here? It uses the annoying euphemisms of typical romance novels and still manages to be even more prudish than usual about descriptions. I hate the “apex of my thighs” business, but that’s common enough. But, “he touched me There”??? That is just dumb. Another reader pointed out to me that if you search for the word ""cock"" in this book, it is never used to refer to a penis, but used about forty times to describe someone ""cocking"" their heads. It is used so much, and so oddly, that Ana even comments on all the head cocking that goes on. Not a super sexy use of a cock.Also, the sex scenes are very logistically difficult to follow, which does not make for hotness in my book. I had no idea what happened during the one with the plastic tie. She somehow hooked her wrists on a bed post? Was she suspended away from the bed post? So confused. But, the weirdest one to me was the first bathtub scene. So, they’re in the bathtub, and she gives him the A+ blowjob, wherein we learn that she has no gag reflex. But . . . how much water was in the bathtub? How did this actually happen? Did they just have a couple of inches of water in the tub? That doesn’t sound very relaxing. If they had a normal amount of water, did she have to do an underwater bj? Did he have to float while she gave him the bj? Did he sit on the side of the tub??? If I don’t even know what’s going on, how am I supposed to consider whether it’s hot or not?Even aside from being confused by the sex scenes, for me, most of this story was strikingly repelling. And I’m talking, like, I think even Pleasuring the Pirate was hotter. I imagine this can’t be true, but it’s possible that this book hits every turn off for me:(1) “Baby.” Don’t ever call me a baby, unless I am actually being a baby. Also, never say “laters” before you say “baby.” The words “laters” and “baby” should never be used individually, and certainly not in the same sentence. Also, never say that like a million times and then discuss how original it is to say it. That makes me puke. (2) Stick insects. Christian Grey appears to be some sort of stick insect with freakishly long tentacle fingers. I am not attracted to stick insects. (3) Contracts. Not hot. (4) Bossiness. I loathe bossiness. Why can’t people just do what they want to do, and also avoid being jerks? Why push everyone around? Unattractive.(4) Boring snobbery. I just can’t abide it. It makes my skin crawl. If you want to be a snob, be a snob about something interesting, not wine and classical music and cars. Be a snob about stage makeup or teacups, or something. I don't know what. Be a snob about your own thing. Why is it cool to be a snob about boring things and nerdy to be a snob about something different? Wine/opera/cars snobbery is so expected. Plus, wine snobbery is impossible to listen to. I like wine, don’t get me wrong, but when people turn their nose up and start to talk vintages in a fake British accent, it is obnoxiously ridiculous. This didn’t actually do that, I imagine because James might ultimately know very little about wine, but it gestured at it as though she wished she could talk bouquets and oaks and vintages. Those are the turn offs I can think of now, but I’m sure there are more. Oh, sitting in a bathtub of menstrual blood is, it turns out, a turn off for me. I knew about the tampon scene, and whipping a tampon out to have sex does not freak me out the way it seems to freak some people. One of my friends got totally freaked out by a part where something similar (though more clearly and eloquently, and also maybe a little more creepily, described) happens in The English Patient, and I remember finding it a little haunting and creepy, but sort of beautiful, there. BUT THEN, in Fifty Shades, SHE DOESN’T PUT A TAMPON BACK IN!! And they go and hang out in the bathtub for a little while. So, that’s disgusting and unnecessary. I am not in favor of hanging out in pools of things that come out of my body. Turn off.Oh, seeing life through the POV of an anorexic – turn off. Locality annoyance: say, “I-5.” “The Interstate 5”? Please. I’m not even going to talk about the subconscious and inner goddess because that is just facially crazy talk. And annoying.Also:The only good thing about this experience was that it allowed me to vent my anger as above, with my Christian Grey Ryan Gosling tumblr. Setting aside all of the distracting writing and the way my personal lady parts shrivel up and hide at all the details of this story, it really is the fact the relationship here that is the worst thing. People have talked this to death, but much of the sex and violence Ana experiences are sex and violence she acquiesces to because she’s too scared to lose a boy, not sex and violence she asks for because she wants them. That is very, very annoying to read about. It’s like listening to a nauseatingly long restraining order hearing while knowing the whole time that it won’t be granted. If you want to sacrifice your life with the hope that a man will change, it’s your life. But, don’t whine to me about your stupid choices.Every single part of this book was terrible.",1

"882","212127083","I did have a lot of fun with it but I can't ignore some of the issues I had with it especially in the first 65% of the book. I did like the concept and plot as an overall but  the way it was executed felt chaotic to me. To me it came across as we're just thrown into the story. I had some trouble getting a handle on the world building and although things are happening at a fast pace to Saeris, it was too wordy. The library bits felt repetitive and  could have been edited better.  The fae world intrigued me a lot tho, especially the whole thing with gods and quicksilver. I believe quicksilver as a whole could have been explained better rather than giving tid bits, it lacked clarity for me especially when things slowed down immensely in the middle. The banter between  Saeris and Kingfisher  🤢😭 was nice. I had a hard time seeing him being called Kingfisher the WHOLE time, so am sticking with Fisher. The chemistry between the two is pretty good in the second half. The  enemies to lovers  vibes were pretty good. Them together in the first half was rushed and there was a lack of emotional depth, it came across as shallow and maybe that's because of their personalities. I liked Fisher more than Saeris, but she won me over in the end. The spice was hot and the romance towards the end thankfully matured. Idk if it's just me but this is the sort of book that  should have been in dual pov.  I feel like giving just Saeris' pov, made it boring at parts and it was like I only got half of the information. The  found family trope  is set up so sweet in this one, I ate it up. The side characters, Ren in particular interest me a lot. I would like to see that trope fleshed out a bit more in the next one. The  ending  was wild. I loved it. The action and the cliffhanger was chef's kiss. But it did remind me a bit of ACOTAR, not that am complaining. I liked the twist a lot. Am eager to read the next book but I really hope it's much better edited.  Thanks to beautiful Lindsey for reading it with me 🥺🩷  ~•~•~The cover is gorgeous😍😍",3

"884","212127083","dnf 30%The review contains spoilers!If I had a nickel for every time I read a book where a human girl ends up in a fairy world, I'd have a lot of nickels, but if I had a nickel for every time I read a book like that that was actually good, I don't know if I'd even have two nickels. I’m honestly too lazy to write a proper review, so let me show you, based on the tropes, why Quicksilver didn’t work out for me. Enemies to lovers? Their ""hate"" was some of the most bland and unoriginal I have ever read about.
  
    ""I hated this male. Hated him with every fiber of my being. But curse me, I wanted him just as bad.""
  
Boring. I fear I've read quotes like this so many times that they no longer have any effect on me.Slow-burn? Who is she? They kissed at thirty percent, and this is just the first book in the series. Romantasy? I think you mean, Lust-asy, or Insta-lust-asy. Great banter? Where?
  
    “Pants and a shirt,” I said dryly. “And a pair of boots with really good soles. Do you have any idea what those boots cost me?” “Let me guess. Your virginity.” “Fuck you, Fisher.” “Sure.” He smirked. “But I'm afraid I don't have any new boots to trade you for your time.” 
  
Hahaha so funny. I’m dying of laughter.  ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Grumpy hero? No no no.Insufferable and mean hero? Yes.
  
    “Maybe the issue is that you asked me a question about my cock like a hungry little bitch in heat and didn't ask me something that mattered.” Gods, but he kept surprising me.""""My jaw was screaming, I was clenching my teeth so hard. “Fuck—you—” “There you go again. Hungry, needy little bitch in heat, begging to be fucked...” he taunted. “Let. Go!” “LIIIIISTENNN!!” Kingfisher's roar snatched my breath away.""
  
Hungry needy bitch in heat? No comment needed here. I don't know what else to say, I'm just disappointed. I was hopeful this book would be something just for me, but sadly, it didn’t live up to my expectations.",NA
"885","212127083","3 ★'sThis was a little bit of a mess. It wasn't all bad but it definitely could've been better.Quicksilver technically has the puzzle pieces for a fantasy romance but they feel randomly thrown together. Some things work, other things doesn’t. As a whole it was just jumbled, confusing and spectacularly ordinaryWhilst I see the potential for this book, I feel incredibly frustrated at how it was executed.It's like someone tried to analyse what made other romantasies a success but have no idea on how to actually accomplish that.For example, I recognise that they tried hard to create that badass, sassy, strong fmc in Saeris - which normally is my favourite type of fmc. The end result ended up simply being just that; try-hard. Her comebacks constantly felt weak, forced and ultimately became quite cringe. I don't think I've ever been more unintrigued by a fmc in a long time. The love interest, Kingfisher(I know, the name should be banned) was at least a tiny bit more interesting. It's unfortunate the only perspective we got in the book was by the least fascinating character. Over to the romance. This author has not heard of slow burn or building tension.They never had enough chemistry for their heated moments, it was always so sudden without any sort of build up. Their ""banter"" was him smelling how aroused she was around him and him being overly cocky about that. I prefer my fictional men well and truly obsessed, please and thank you - but as we never got his perspective we didn't really get to see that, now did we.👎 I did enjoy some scenes between them, especially in the second half. However, exactly everything felt too rushed when it came to their romance and I think you just have to accept that if you want to enjoy this. Over to the writing. It consisted of run-on sentences, an overuse of the word 'fuck'*, long-ass chapters and plot holes on top of plot holes. One of my favourite thing about reading a fantasy romance is the world building and the magic systems. For me that is where the story truly comes alive. In this book that was an afterthought and doesn't seem particularly thought through. We get no explanation on how their magic works or what powers they have. Based on reading this, it seems as if there are absolutely no limitations to it, which is such a lazy move on the author's part.The writer constantly chose convenience over clarity or logic, and it angered me every time.Trying to end this on a somewhat positive note, this definitely gave me those fae fantasy vibes I've been longing for.🧚 I do think the overall story is interesting enough, even if it's incredibly overhyped in my opinion. For me this book was carried by the side characters; Onyx, Wendy, Carrion, Lorreth & Ren. All my love goes to them. I'd be fine if they kill off Saeris in the next one tbh.*The word fuck(or versions, e.g. fucking) was used 387 times according to my kindle._________⌞pre-read:⌝I am in desperate need of a real good fantasy rn.

  My Thoughts:
I have not enjoyed a lot of of the popular romantasy book recommendations lately, so I am pleased to say that this was fucking fantastic! Okay, so what did I like about this story???The world-building and magic system is intriguing. It all felt familiar in the sense that if you dabble in the fantasy or paranormal genres, you've probably read plenty of stories with fae, vampires, gods, portal magic, etc. However, this was done in a unique way so it felt like a fresh concept. I don't want to say anything more because it would spoil things, but I am curious to learn more about the Quicksilver and dive deeper into the politics of these worlds and other forms of magic. Saeris Fane is a breath of fresh air. She is strong-willed, scrappy, straight-forward, and persistent: a survivor. Since Saeris is the main character in a world with magic, she does have a secret gift that gets explored throughout the story, but it's developed in a realistic way. Yes, Saeris is unique, special, and powerful, but not in the obnoxious 'Chosen One' sort of way that's been repeatedly done. I also liked how she can be snarky and sassy at times without coming off as immature. Saeris is definitely one of my favorite FMCs and I'm so excited to see how her character develops in book 2!Kingfisher. Powerful, intimidating, dangerous, and, of course, sexy. At first, I really hated him. 😂 He was SUCH a dick to Saeris with no explanation why. However, as the story progresses, you realize he's also fiercely loyal, protective, and selfless. There's nothing he wouldn't do for the people he loves and those he's responsible for. I liked that this story is single POV so we learned more about Kingfisher and ended up falling in love with him along with Saeris. The ONLY thing I didn't love was his name. I'm glad most people call him Fisher instead of Kingfisher (which is a bird), but I am almost positive the author chose this name as some sort of foreshadowing. From my research, kingfishers in literature symbolize the rise and fall of civilizations, which is definitely relevant to this story. The romance ATE! There's amazing banter, delicious tension, and the spice is *chef's fucking kiss*! Almost every interaction between Saeris and Fisher had me kicking and screaming in a giddy sort of way. You never knew if these two were going to fight or fuck and I was living for it. I loved how Saeris would try to brush off her attraction to Fisher with rude or snarky comments but he'd always turn it around on her and she'd leave the conversations hot and bothered. For example:""I wouldn't fuck you - if you were the last living -""""Don't bother."" The words held bite. ""Lying is pointless with your heart betraying you so loudly.""""It's beating fast because I'm afraid,"" I snapped.""Of me?"" Kingfisher huffed a blast of laughter down his nose. ""No, you're not. You should be, but you're not. That's one of the things I like most about you. . . You want to touch me the way I'm touching you, don't you? To feel the weight of me beneath your palms. The heat of me . . .""""You're wrong.""He shook his head. ""I'm not. . . I can smell you, Little Osha, and I'm thinking about drinking the sweet nectar you're making for me straight from the fucking cup.""And of course, the actual spice had me in a chokehold! These scenes are open door, explicit and very detailed. Like, pages and pages worth of smut. 🔥 And Fisher's dirty talk is superior. I'm legit getting sweaty just glancing over some of the things he says. Once Fisher and Saeris stop denying their attraction for each other, they share a few sweet and tender moments between. Whenever he calls her 'little Osha' my stomach flutters with butterflies. 🦋 The scene where he takes her hands and puts it on her heart so she can feel it beat, had me in my feels. 🥺 💕 And the note. 😭 Their love made me emotional and horny all at the same time. The premise / plot is exciting! The beginning starts off with a bang as Saeris runs from one of the Queen's guard, and from that point on, there's always something going on whether it's political intrigue, developing romance, training, or fights. I liked how there's a relatively equal focus between the romance and story plot so that one doesn't overwhelm or take away from the over. And that ending!!!! Oh my gosh!!!! I genuinely did not see those reveals and the turn of events coming! Again, can't say much without spoiling, but just prepare to experience a kaleidoscope of emotions. Two things to note: the story is a bit long and it may take a second to get into. However, I didn't think the length was a problem since it all felt relevant to the plot and world development. There’s so many layers to this story and the more you read, the more invested you’ll find yourself. Also, I typically have to read 10% of a fantasy story to figure out if I'm going to enjoy it or not. These things weren't issues for me, but I want to mention them since I've seen a few reviews talking about these points. Overall, Quicksilver is a captivating, swoon-worthy romantasy that swept me off my feet. Depending on the next books in the series, it could easily become one of my all-time favorite series! I wish I could read the next book immediately, and I’m so sad we have to wait an entire year for it. But also, kudos to Callie Hart for having this book get picked up by a publisher! Well deserved!

"888","212127083","“For those who live their nightmares so that others may have their dreams.”Where do I even BEGIN??? Without a doubt one of my favorite reads of the year! Obsessed is actually the biggest understatement. Everything I want out of a fantasy romance book and them some! I am truly blown away that this is the authors first book in this genre, it was PERFECTION and I will be making it my entire personality. The world building is very easy to digest and I was immediately sucked in from the second I started reading. I found it actually impossible to put this book down. The perfect balance of plot and romance. The magic system was unlike anything I’ve ever read before and I love how it plays such an integral role in the overall story. There were times where I thought I knew where things were going, then I was absolutely gob smacked by how wrong I was. The last 200 pages had me white knuckling my book. The action and battles scenes were absolutely INCREDIBLE!Don’t even get me started on shadow daddy Fisher… this man…. THIS MAN!! Let’s just say my top 10 book boyfriends have some serious competition. He is so grumpy and territorial and possessive and a little bit toxic but in the BEST WAY POSSIBLE!! I mean he’s Fae, what do you expect? His mouth???!! Every time he spoke all the feminism left my body. Such a shameless flirt and I ate up every second of it. I surprisingly loved not getting his POV because it added to the mystery and intrigue of him as a character, and trust me this man has secrets. I need him on a level that probably isn’t healthy and I don’t care. His nickname for her means “most sacred” I MEAN COME ON. “I'll happily kiss all of your aches and pains better for you once we strike camp. I've been told my mouth has healing properties. Especially when administered between a pair of thighs.”“She is moonlight. The mist that shrouds the mountains. The bite of electricity in the air before a storm. The smoke that rolls across a battlefield before the killing starts. You have no idea what she is. What she could be. You should call her Majesty.”“I'll be grateful for every second that I can say that I belong to you, Saeris Fane. Eighty years or eighteen hours. It doesn't matter to me. It'll still be the highest honor of my life.”Our FMC Saeris is such a confident badass but not in an annoying, “pick me” way. She knows what she wants and goes after it but actually thinks her decisions through and doesn’t act on pure emotion, shocking I know. And her overall mindset is so empowering! I cannot wait to see her character grow throughout the series!THE ROMANCE!!!! You can feel the chemistry oozing out of the pages. The banter between Saeris and Fisher is chefs fucking kiss, the tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife. It’s giving soulmates and I will find you in every lifetime. It’s advertised as enemies to lovers but I personally wouldn’t describe it as enemies to lovers i would say it’s more “I really don’t like you and I don’t know why to lovers”, but I still ate it up.The side characters were so well flushed out and impossible not to fall in love with! The found family was EVERYTHING, I’m already so emotionally attached to them and it’s only book 1!!!“Be unrelenting and unmerciful in the face of the wicked dead. And if you should find your soul sundered from flesh, order a drink for us at the first tavern you come across in the afterlife. We’ll settle the tab when we get there.”This book is for you if you love:✔️found family✔️enemies to lovers✔️grumpy shadow daddy MMC✔️unique magic system✔️delicious banter and tension✔️slow burn✔️fated mates✔️badass FMC✔️spicy spice",5

I was wrong; because what was this even supposed to be? I might be slightly overreacting, this was not such an awful book, it was pretty ok (as it can also be seen from my rating), but I guess my expectations were a bit too high, and I was, therefore, left rather disappointed.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ""Quiksilver"" is the typical romantasy book that you will find around lately; a lot of very popular tropes, a lot cliches that are unfortunately not suitably adapted to the book's characters and action and a really dark MMC who wants to be morally grey. ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ The story of the book follows Saeris a thief with a noble heart who is struggling to survive together with her brother in the city of Zilvaren, whose heartless queen rules without mercy or compassion. Once forced to be brought in front of the said queen to be judged, Saeris finds the true depths of the queen's malice, but fate has other plans for her and when a mysterious, dark and brooding man saves her just in time, she finds herself in the middle of the political intrigues of an unknown kingdom. Of course, the brooding man is none other than Kingfisher who, despite his very unfortunate and horrible name, is the most beautiful man Saeris has ever laid her eyes on. Oh, did I say man? My apologies, I meant to say male because, as you probably already guessed, he is fae. From here starts the whole adventure of loyalty, misunderstood heroes and brave companions, all revolving around the funny, even though a bit childish at times, banter between our main characters. Spice could not be missed from such a recipe of a story, even though I, at least, would have appreciated it way more if 80% out of it was indeed missed. But it is all leading towards the very ending of the book where the FMC might find herself in a very different, very new, and very intriguing position.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ I will just proceed with my analysis below without wasting any more time.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍
  -ˋˏ ༻ world-building, writing and action ༺ ˎˊ-
 ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ The world-building in this novel is really excellent, and it is probably the only aspect of it that I found completely satisfactory. There are hardly any extraneous details, and the world is intriguingly and fairly well-constructed, revealing more and more information to you as the reader as the novel goes on. It really did seem a little unique, which was exactly what I needed to keep me intrigued.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍On the other hand, I genuinely have nothing to say about the writing. It is not bad, it is not good either. It was basic, a touch bland, and sometimes even a little fanfiction-ish. It had no business having such long chapters in the first half of the book.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ There is not much to say about the action in the book either. The action was pretty captivating, a bit slow at times, and gave the appearance that it was focused on insignificant issues, but overall, it was very adequate and even entertaining at moments.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ 
  -ˋˏ ༻ characters ༺ ˎˊ-
ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ I refuse to believe these characters' ages vary between the range of 24 and 1800. These people acted like teenagers more than once and it was becoming so hard for me to remember that they are adults in so many instances.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ❀ Saeris - I want to make this very clear, I do not like this character. I do not think there is something specific wrong with her, but I just couldn't, for the love of God, appreciate her as a main character. I am not sure if it was due to the manner in which she was presented in the book, but she was so uninteresting, and it was so hard to relate to her through the novel. She does not evolve in any special way; she, somehow, already possesses every attribute that may make every single person she meets fall for her, and she just does not elicit empathy.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ❀ Kingfisher - Apart from having one of the worst names ever given to a MMC, there isn't really much to say about him either. He is the dark, brooding, and misunderstood, yet absolutely noble hero who suffered time and time again for the good of his people. He is, by far, way more intriguing as a character than Saeris, but once you really try to go deeper into his character, you do not really find much apart from the sexual/funny banter and his constant willingness to sacrifice for everything and everyone around him. There was way more potential behind this character.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ❧ I really need writers to stop promoting everything as enemies to lovers and slow-burn; because these two tropes lasted for about 20 pages after the characters met and that simply does not fulfil the requirements for any of these elements. This was very insta-love(lust?) and despite having about 500 pages of these characters together, I could not feel any real chemistry or genuine feelings between them by the end of this book. There was real potential for this romance, but unfortunately it got buried under unnecessary tropes. Not to mention that the ending opens the possibility towards a really...strange..thing.ㅤㅤ ❀ Ren, Lorreth, Everlayne - They were genuinely really fun side characters. I loved them to be honest. Not much to say about them, but I loved them.ㅤㅤ ❀ Carrion - thank you for your service, king!!! This book would have genuinely been so much worse without his jokes and funny banters with...well, everyone.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ 
  -ˋˏ ༻ ending and conclusions ༺ ˎˊ-
ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ Now, I am not sure what could be said about the ending of this book so it could perfectly encompass what I truly felt about it, but I will try to describe it using a question:is there any plot left for the rest of the books in this series, because why did so many different events have to be compressed into such a short span of pages? The ending seemed rushed, and there were so many disclosures and events happening at once that I became overwhelmed. Not to add that the finale, due to how it was constructed, fails to ignite your interest in reading the rest of the series. There may have been many fewer details supplied in this ending, which could have been left for the second book and piqued the reader's interest significantly.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ I don't think there is much to say as a conclusion for this book. It was not a bad novel, but it was really far from being the amazing piece of literature so many people advertised it as. If you want a quite entertaining, slightly long book that will give you some of the most popular book tropes right now, then absolutely go for this. But do not go into it expecting too much, because I made that mistake, and now, I am left slightly disappointed.ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ I will be reading the second book as well, but it would be solely due to my curiosity regarding the plot and its direction. Apart from that, this is not really a read that piqued my interest.────────────────────────ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍  ᯓ ✿ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍pre-reading ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ⪼ ㅤ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ ‍‍‍‍‍‍ yes, it is finally time 🙌🏻 i don't even need to mention how many amazing things I've heard about this, so needless to say, I am so excited!!!",2

    ""Of course Death was beautiful. How else would anyone chose to go with him without putting up a fight?
  
I am still debating on how I want to rate this and I might even come back and change it later. The beginning started off strong and had me completely intrigued. It had so much potential, but the middle 200 or so pages I struggled with. I found myself not really knowing where the plot or story was going. The pace was a little off and nothing was really happening. At this point I was going to rate it a 3 maybe 3.5 Hearing such amazing reviews I decided to keep reading and see where it would take me✨. Then the ending came and BOOM BAM...WHAT???👀👀👀....You know those moments where you just look at your book/kindle like What just happened?🤣That ending completely made up for it.✨ I can not wait for the second one to come out in October!!✨*:･ﾟ✧Plot*:･ﾟ✧Saeris Fane is a human girl living in a desert land who is good at two things: keeping secrets and stealing. She steals to survive and to take care of her younger brother who constantly finds himself in the middle of trouble. One day, Saeris finds that her stealing catches up to her and the guards have come to take her to the Queen. After her and her family are sentenced to death, a mysterious man in a pool of quicksilver rescues her and takes her to another realm. When she wakes up, she realizes she has been thrown into a world of fae and war, and the only way she can get back home is to help the King. *:･ﾟ✧Tropes*:･ﾟ✧✨Unique Magic System✨Magical Creatures✨Found Family✨Enemies to Lovers✨Fated Mates✨Bad-Ass FMC✨Grumpy MMC✨Banter and Tension✨Forced proximity✨Spice*:･ﾟ✧Saeris Fane*:･ﾟ✧I really enjoyed Saeris, from the very beginning, she was a survivor. Sassy, smart, and quick-witted, she was not afraid to accept a challenge or defend those she loved. With no living parents, it was up to her to take care of herself and her younger brother. Saeris is different and she knows it but doesn't quite understand these unusual abilities. 
  
    ""The rebels my mother had helped before her death had done more than hide in our attic. They had trained me. Taught me how to steal. How to survive. How to fight. And now I fought like hell's own fury made flesh.""

*:･ﾟ✧Kingfisher*:･ﾟ✧Kingfisher moved with the shadows, dark, mysterious and half-insane. He was a brooding MMC, labeled as a traitor, and disliked by many. Deep down though, its a facade to block others out. He is extememly loyal and would battle the world for those he cared about. 
  
    ""Humans are usually weak, fickle creatures, but I'll admit, I admire this one's loyalty. She values her family over everything else. There's something to be said for that.""
  
*:･ﾟ✧Side Characters*:･ﾟ✧The found family trope was my favorite in this book. Carrion was hilarious and helped bring humor to the story. Everlayne is the sweetest and was a friend to Saeris with no questions asked. Ren and Lorreth, I loved their undying loyalty to Kingfisher and their backstories that made them all so close. *:･ﾟ✧Saeris & Kingfisher*:･ﾟ✧Enemies to lovers, tension, and banter. This romance was a little of everywhere. One minute they hated each other and then the next minute it was insta-lust that lacked emotional depth. However, towards the end of the story it did develop much better.💓

Kingfisher has secrets of his own and is willing to do whatever it takes to save his people, even if it means binding himself to a human. the oath is clear: she must work for him in exchange for her freedom once the task is done. but the devil is in the details…➼ Saeris Fane🦋she’s the epitome of a survivor, LITERALLY. you’ll know it when you’ll read it🤣she’s indeed survived all her life, trying to protect those she loves, especially her brother. she’s always up for a challenge and knows her way with a sword. she’s different somehow but doesn’t know what makes her so special. i liked saeris, she’s strong but i wouldn’t say she’s a badass fmc. yes, she always accepts a challenge but that hardly makes her one… i feel like her character is incomplete, it lacks something. that spark that makes her special. ➼ Kingfisher⚔️first of all, sorry–but what kind of name is Kingfisher😭 i couldn’t take him seriously at first. thank god he goes with fisher i’m still hoping he has another name…he’s shadows and mystery and hotness and half-insane all at once. he has a grumpy side and dirty mouth (and mind… iykyk👀). he has a torturous past and his secrets are a burden on his shoulders. i liked him but–again–the character feels incomplete. ➼ Saeris & Fisher🦋⚔️i liked them as a couple, somehow they make sense. their banter was entertaining and the tension did its job. they remind me sm of rhys and feyre tbh. tho, the slow burn wasn’t slow burning at all. not that i minded, but you can’t call this a slow burn. yes, there was tension, but it didn’t last for too long. tho, i appreciated the spicy spice🌶️!! sorry let’s take a minute to mention the one and only…➼ Carrion Swift✨i bet his back hurts bc he fucking carried the book. dare i say my fav character?💅🏼 he was hilarious and the funniest! every time he had a line, he nailed it. i hope to god i’ll have the chance to read more of him bc i love him!!!overall, i’d say i enjoyed it and liked it but not loved it. this book is good. is it perfect? no, but you can easily enjoy it. the writing is not the best tbh, it’s sometimes confusing but it’s not too hard to read. the pace was kinda slow in the beginning and, i must admit, it took me almost the 50% to truly get into the story. the second half was more fast paced and i loved it. the magic system is unique, i’d never encountered it before. the ending was meh. it happened so much that i really, truly don’t know what could be possibly happening in the next ones. i think i need to read the second one to really understand whether i’d recommend this series or not.if you’ve read it, pls let’s have a chat💅🏼
  
     It was harsh, but sometimes the cruel things we said served the kindest purpose.“Should we, uh... knock?” An arrogant smile curled up at the corner of his mouth. “Sure,” he said, as if this was a charming suggestion made by a single-brain-celled idiot. A second later, he slammed the sole of his boot against the wood, and then the door was on the ground in pieces. “Knock knock.” He stepped to one side, holding his hand out in a mockery of manners, gesturing for me to go ahead of him. “I don't think anyone's home.”I hadn't seen many beautiful things in my short life. But, of all the beautiful things I had seen, Fisher was the most beautiful of all.“I don't hate your kind. I'm just disappointed by how breakable you are. If I held you down and fucked you the way I'm imagining fucking you right now, I doubt that you’d survive it.”This was the kiss to end all kisses.To me, Kingfisher was a surly, foul-mouthed bastard who I wouldn't piss on even if he was on fire. To everyone inside this tavern, he was a living fucking god.“We are nothing alike,” he said quietly. “You nearly died from a scratch that would have been a mild irritation to me. You are soft. You are fragile. You are vulnerable. You are a newborn fawn, stumbling around in the dark, surrounded by predators with very sharp teeth. I am the thing that exists on the other side of the dark. I’m the thing that puts the fear of the gods into the monsters who would eat you bones and all.”Every warrior in Innìr will smell me on you, Fisher's voice rumbled in my mind. I'm going to make you hoarse from screaming my fucking name. I'm going to mark you in every way imaginable, so that everyone knows you're fucking mine.“You’re making a weird face,” Carrion whispered loudly. “Are you talking to it?”“Yes, I'm talking to it. What do you think I'm doing?”“I don't know. You look constipated.”“Then we do as all dying things do. We return to the dirt, and the sea, and the sky. We sleep. We evolve. We change. We transcend.”“I just love it when you disappear into tense conversations with creepy portal metal,” Carrion quipped, hoisting himself up to sit on the bench. “It's fascinating watching you do all of those facial gymnastics.”You're the chink in my armor, Saeris. The soft spot where the knife slides in.“It’s the most beautiful thing a person can experience in this lifetime. They glow blue and pink and silver, with an ethereal light. They have music, though no one knows how. A sweet, soft song that’s capable of healing. The Oshellith mate and lay their eggs, but once that’s done, they fill the air, and they dance. Protecting them while they live is considered a sacred rite that many die in order to perform. That’s what Oshellith means in Old Fae, Saeris. Most Sacred.”“I am selfish, Saeris. I wanted something quiet and small and special for the both of us. Something we could keep.”There were moments that were gifts, meant to be cherished only for as long as you could remember them.“I'll be grateful for every second that I can say that I belong to you, Saeris Fane. Eighty years or eighteen hours. It doesn't matter to me. It'll still be the highest honor of my life.”Carrion held the sword, turning it this way and that. After much consideration, he said, “It looks like a Simon.”ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ “For those who live their nightmares so that others may have their dreams.”",3

SO BAD why did it take up full chapters IT WAS SO LONG yeah I didn’t not enjoy reading the spice but it definitely gave me a good laugh! also, why is this book being marketed as enemies to lovers when it’s far from it? authors will call any characters that dislike each other enemies to lovers these days. anyways! this was hate to love. reluctant allies to lovers. they are not enemies! — now onto more positive things! the characters! :) •̩̩͙⊱ saeris fane - honestly I loved her character!

  For those who live their nightmares so that others may have their dreams.
.ೃ࿐2 ☆Booktok strikes again, and this one I’m afraid is unsalvageable. The best parts of this book were the dedication and the ending that couldn’t have come soon enough. Mind you, I went into this with no expectations despite of all the praise so just imagine if I had any. I truly struggled and dreaded to pick this book up, and it felt like each time I did I was going to DNF it, but I persevered dumb I know so I could tell you it doesn’t get better at any point. But then again, maybe this one’s on me because I read a book where the MMC’s name is Kingfisher.At about 200 pages, I truly had to go and confirm if this was the same book that everyone was raving about as though it was a masterpiece, because my naïve self truly thought that booktok wouldn’t be as gullible as to praise this as much as they have for it to be a total disaster. And I can understand why people would like this, but for it to gain the attention it has is honestly unfathomable. This is marketed as an enemies to lovers slow burn and my question is: 
  where? Literally where???
 The enemies are nowhere to be found and the slow burn was insta lust as hell. And you know what I’m still searching for? The found family. I mean you guys must be Sherlocks because I still have not found it.In romantasy the romance is mostly at the forefront of the book but it’s still a fantasy, therefore the world building and plot might be done simpler but they still have to be there, make sense and be consistent. Well, guess what? This had none of that. The romance was awful but the fantasy was even worse. It felt like the author was trying to bridge the gap between romantasy and high fantasy and it was painful to read to say the least. 『 °*•Characters•*°』⋆.˚🦋༘⋆Saeris is probably the most insufferable female main character that I have ever read about. The author wants you to believe she’s a sassy, badass, sarcastic, strong, independent FMC, when in reality she was an unbearable, dumb, rude, whiny brat with a superiority complex. When I tell you, this girl 
  lacks a brain
 with the actions and things she says and thinks I’m not exaggerating. If this was a YA maybe I could’ve overlooked some things, but she’s in her twenties for god’s sake there’s eight year olds with more brain power than her. I felt like I was getting dumber with each page I read just by being in her head. She’s so uninteresting as a main character and felt like everything was handed to her and made easy for her, and after 600 pages there was no character growth whatsoever.⋆.˚🦋༘⋆Kingfisher is a Fae with almost two thousand years old that most of the time read like an emo teenager. There’s not much to say other than he feels like every other misunderstood MMC. He was one of the most bearable parts of this book and would’ve been such an intriguing character if he wasn’t so surface leveled. I think there was so much more potential, but the FMC just overshadowed him in a way.ᯓᡣ𐭩 At the end of the day, the only likable character was Carrion Swift and his smart mouth.⋆.˚🦋༘⋆Over to the romance lust *cough cough*, it felt so shallow. It honestly pissed me off the way the author was trying so hard to shove the enemies to lovers trope down our throats. Saeris had no reason to hate Fisher with every fiber of her being. When she said that at 30% while they were having a moment I had to go back and reread the scene to see if I had missed something, because it came so out of left field. If you are writing this trope at least try and have a reason for them to be enemies.Also, the author would talk about their love and how they’re fated to be but in the end there was no chemistry and everything felt forced with no angst or tension buildup, everything was based on pure lust. Sometimes they would be having a normal conversation and the author would insert some sexual innuendo that came from nowhere, just for the sake of calling it “banter”. And can we talk about that real quick? Where was the “amazing banter” everyone was talking about? ‧₊˚🖇️ ”It’s Saeris. My name. Call me, that or nothing at all.” ┊“Nothing at all? I like the sound of that. Come here and look at this, Nothing At All.”*ೃ༄Was this it? Seriously? What are we? Twelve?『 °*•World Building and Plot•*°』It had an interesting concept but the execution was chaotic. I think not even the author knows the world she built and it shows, because it’s often nonsensical, with no logic and so many inconsistencies and plot holes.Saeris lives in the third Ward where poverty reigns and water is rationed but not alcohol. In the first pages, we learn the Third is a quarantined place where no one can get out of because they are contagious. Of what? After 600 pages we still don’t know because this whole plot is dropped not to be mentioned again.The FMC is caught outside the Third and when a guardian catches her, he is terrified to learn she’s from the Third. She manages to steal from him and gets away with it, but then the guardians raid the Third in search of the item. This made no sense! Why would 30 guardians enter a place that is quarantined when they were afraid to touch her in the first place? And then they just get her out of there and there’s no problems with touching, I guess she’s cured then? intensive eye rollAnd the water rations were a joke. I mean, there’s a tavern that sells alcohol without being rationed make it make sense.I honestly could be here all day, listing all the plot holes and nonsense, but just trust me when I say there’s more. And this was a recurrent theme throughout the book, where the author would start a plot point and never finish it or even mention it again. The plot was inexistent, confusing, the pace was all over the place and for almost the entirety of the book it felt like we had nothing to look forward to.『 °*•Writing•*°』It mainly consisted of word vomited long ass paragraphs, with so many repetitions and over descriptions. I think I read the sentence ”Gods and Martyrs” over fifty times. The chapters were dead ass long and poorly edited.

"904","212127083","6 stars!OMG, this book! Get ready for my newest obsession, because I freaking loved this book! Callie Hart has entered the world of romantasy, and I am here for it, with fantastic world building, amazing characters, and a chemistry-filled enemies-to-lovers romance, I loved everything about this one. Within a few pages, I was hooked, and within a few chapters, I knew that I was reading something really special. It’s fun, exciting, romantic and unpredictable, and it’s a fave for 2024.Saeris is a human girl living in a desert land and stealing to survive. She’s smart, sassy and brave, and I loved her instantly. When Saeris’ thievery catches up to her, she is sentenced to death, but instead is rescued by a mysterious man and taken to another realm. Now, a guest at the Winter Palace in Yvelia, she is welcomed into a small group of fae who are determined to help her unlock her hidden powers of alchemy, and recruit her to their cause to reopen the pathways between worlds once again, helping them to win a centuries-long war. This intro barely scrapes the surface of this story. There is so much going on in in this book, and I was completely sucked into it all. But what I enjoyed most was the characters. Saeris is a wonderfully entertaining heroine, and the whole story is from her POV, which I loved, as we get to discover the world, its inhabitants, and her newly arising power right along with her. And then there is Kingfisher, the fae who rescued Saeris from certain death. He seems to hate her on sight, but he is sexy, mysterious, irresistibly tormented and brilliantly sarcastic and of course I fell wildly in love with him. 
  “Urgh! Do you have to be so difficult?”His eyes danced. “It isn’t mandatory, but I do enjoy it.”
Their banter is epic, and I could feel the chemistry sizzling between them, and every interaction had my heart pounding with anticipation. Fisher constantly teases and taunts Saeris, but there’s a sense of something more between them, and the fantastic ‘I hate you but I want you’ vibes that I love about an enemies to lovers romance. 
Fisher dipped his head so that his mouth was unreasonably close to mine. “I've fucked plenty of humans,” he whispered. “Does that surprise you?” “Yes. Seeing as how you... seem to hate us... so much.” His mouth. Gods, his fucking mouth. I needed to look away. I had to. “I don't hate your kind. I'm just disappointed by how breakable you are. If I held you down and fucked you the way I'm imagining fucking you right now, I doubt that you’d survive it.”
The love story is a slow burn, and I get the feeling that we only just get a taste of the epicness to come for these two, but I loved watching them come together. They are honest with each other, they share so much of themselves, and their slow shift into friendship and then more is sexy, intense, and beautifully emotional. 
  “I’ll be grateful for every second that I can say I belong to you, Saeris Fane.”
There are a fantastic circle of friends who join them along the way, each of them bringing something unique to the story. It’s a wonderful ‘found family’ feel, with minor storylines for them shaped really well, and I loved their interactions, their teasing, and their heartfelt care for each other. Callie Hart has done a phenomenal job building this world. The complexity of the story unfolds organically throughout the book, so I never felt overwhelmed with a massive info-dump, and I never knew what was going to happen next, which I loved! There were scenes that I went back and re-read because I loved it so much and wanted to soak it all in. She’s created a fantastic world full of magic and fantasy creatures, and after the heart-poundingly exciting end to this one, I cannot wait to see where the story goes from here.This book ends in a good place, and while it’s not exactly a cliffhanger, there are some pretty huge twists to end the story and I’m so excited for more. Such a fantastic read, and a fave for 2024. 6 massive stars. An Advanced Review Copy was generously provided by the author for an honest review.",5
"905","212127083","2 STARS for the ending — Most of my critique is due to poor writing and editing. The book should have been 200 pages shorter, and there were typos, run-on sentences, and plot inconsistencies throughout. Though no fault of the author, BookTok seems cursed with the inability to correctly categorize tropes because this was nothing more than a mediocre romantasy. It is NOT enemies-to-lovers, nor is it a slow burn. The found family was never found and the supposed razor-sharp banter was more akin to a dull knife. The character names were an interesting choice as well. Her nickname is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and his ""real name"" is Kingfisher.Was tempted to DNF at the 25-30% mark, but it's difficult to fully evaluate without finishing. So I persevered, and can now confirm that while things did pick up slightly in the very end, it's not worth reading 500 pages of insta-lust in exchange for 100 pages of fantasy plot points that are done better elsewhere.",2

"911","212127083","I might as well stop reading now because I've found my favorite fantasy book of the year.After seeing BookTok gush over Quicksilver, I decided to give this book a whirl. I went in completely blind, and I'm so glad I did.This book has everything you could ever want in a romantasy book, and then some. A Katniss Everdeen-like protagonist? Check. A messy-haired, chisel-jawed, morally grey fae love interest? Absolutely. Vampires, witches, and intricate world-building? You betcha!But Quicksilver goes even deeper than those surface-level elements. Its magic system is complex and fascinating, with attributes I haven't encountered before. The side characters are interesting and multi-dimensional. The dialogue feels authentic, and even though the stakes are incredibly high, I found myself laughing out loud at times thanks to jokes made by Carrion, my favorite character.Do I recommend this book? WHOLEHEARTEDLY. It's long, and I never wanted it to end, which to me is the ultimate sign of a great book. I can't wait for the sequel.",5
"912","57693481","1 starFair warning, this review will be full of 
  spoilers
 so if you plan on reading this, I would tread carefully. But, you should also read this so you don't waste your time with this monstrosity 🥰 This will also be one of my messiest review yetThe one lesson I learned from this was to actually listen to other people when they tell you to avoid a bookThis book is absolutely disgusting. I’ve spent the last 2 days I read this book trying to figure what the Cooper’s (H) personality is besides being absolute piece of shit. Mac (h) begins emotionally cheating on her boyfriend, Preston, of 4 years after meeting the hero ONCE and begins physically cheating on him 1/3 of the way through the book.Preston is not a good guy, at all, but to the heroine, he’s a good guy that she doesn’t feel chemistry with. Does he cheat on her and treat people like shit because others aren’t rich like him? Absolutely, but does that make it okay for her to cheat on him??? No.It’s not even just this…she has the audacity to talk about his cheating in a negative way. Baby girl you cheated on him too💀Cooper was fired from his job because of her boyfriend so to get back at him, Cooper’s friends and him make a bet. He’ll get the heroine to fall for him, break up with her boyfriend and rub it in her bf’s face😒 wtf is this? Wattpad?The justification they have for manipulating and being cruel to the heroine is she’s just a “clone”😒 It’s the hypocrisy that these people show that is laughable. They act like they’re dirt poor and because of that they’re allowed to treat people like shit. How about everyone just shows each other some fucking respect. “She’s a person, you know.”“No, she’s a clone.”
I get wanting to bully your bully, I support that. But, for them to put an innocent person in the middle of this revenge plot...that's so childishCooper tells Mac that her boyfriend has been cheating on her the whole 2 years that he was away for college. So she slaps him….huh??!! What gives you the right to slap someone that is telling YOUR BOYFRIEND IS CHEATING ON YOU 5 seconds after making out with Cooper???Well Cooper and Mac don’t talk to each other for a while after that. When Mac goes to dinner with her boyfriend and her parents, she gets pissed by the way they treat her like dirt. Because of that, she FINALLY questions her bf about his possible infidelity, which he admits.Here’s where I can’t take this anymore. After breaking up with her boyfriend OF 4 YEARS, she goes to Cooper’s house and they have sex for the first time. How this girl realized that she never loved her boyfriend and is already fucking her side piece who she BARELY knows, all in ONE HOUR, I will never know. Not only this...but the sex scene is 🤣
“You gonna come again?” he whispers in my ear.“Maybe.”“Try.”Cooper eventually starts having doubts about the bet, which is supposed to make it “okay” since he feels bad. I'm sure you’re expecting him to just come clean to Mac about it…NOPE. He allows his friends and brother to degrade a girl he likes by calling her a clone and laugh behind her back. He then LIES about the bet to her face multiple times and even gets his friends to back up his story.“Out with it,” she orders.“With what?”Even as I stonewall her, I wonder if this is the moment I should come clean. Admit I had less than honorable intentions at first, but that things changed after we met.She’d understand. Maybe even get a kick out of it. We’d have a good laugh and it’d become a funny story we tell at parties.
Despite her cheating, Mac is probably the best character in the book. Cooper is probably the worst because he THINKS he's better than everyone else. Mac got a call from two of Cooper’s friends after a hole tore through their roof during a hurricane. Mac drives out, climbs on the roof and is able to repair the hole temparily. When Cooper finds out that she did that she literally starts condescending her like she’s a child which was giving me 🚩🚩“Hey, it’s fine. I’m fine. They needed help so I offered to come over. It was my decision.”“I don’t give a shit whose dumbass idea it was. You shoulda known better,” he tells me with a condescending tone, not unlike the one I heard from Preston when I showed him the hotel.Mac forgets that she has no clothes on besides her bra and underwear so when she stands up to defend herself… “Oh my God, I did not almost get struck by lightning. You’re being ridiculous right now.” Indignant, I plant my hands on my hips, forgetting about the blanket wrapped around me.It falls to the wet carpet, leaving me in nothing but a black sports bra and neon-pink bikini panties.Am I the only one cringing? Then Cooper takes her home and fucks her because Mac likes to allow herself to be treated like a doormat. Maybe I'm just being picky at this point, but yanno what...sometimes it's necessaryCooper also makes Mac feel like shit because she’s wealthy. When his mom steals all his life savings from him, Mac offers to replace it because well, she has the money. I understand some people don’t like to feel like charity cases…but Cooper just goes off on her. “How many different ways do I have to say it?” he shouts at me. “I don’t want your goddamn money. Do you even grasp how infantilizing it is to have your girlfriend constantly following you around with her purse open?”
He then proceeds to degrade her by calling her a 'clone'…SHE’S LITERALLY YOUR GIRLFRIEND WTF. Her intentions are pure. In no way was she trying to degrade him or show off by offering to give him money.Mac eventually finds out about the bet at 91% and they make up at the end of the book. This book just felt like After by Anna Todd. The bet trope has been done…we’re all over it. It wasn’t even a good trope to begin with so can we please never use it again.",1
"913","57693481","it took me 3 weeks to get through this book. THREE FUCKING WEEKS, let that sink in. have y’all read ‘After’ by Anna Todd? did you love it and just want more? well look no further! good girl complex is.. the exact.. same.. thing. a literal replica of that storyline. I’m not gonna lie, I got to 60% of this book and then I skimmed the rest of it. it was so predictable, not for one second did I wonder where the story was gonna go. I didn’t connect or like any of the characters. Cooper was okay, but Mackenzie.. sos. the glorification of cheating trope is not my favorite, and this book had a lot of that. anyway, I really tried to love this, but I wanted more than just good girl meets bad boy, she’s rich & he isn’t, opposites attract, blah blah blah. the ending felt a bit rushed & there was no epilogue, overall I was very disappointed :/",2

"918","57693481","Two individuals from the opposite side of the tracks that meet under circumstances that lead them to be together in a rough and sensual way...
Another Elle Kennedy masterpiece. A piece of work that I have been waiting for, I have been craving for this kind of Elle's writing. I was starting to go downhill with her previous spin off books, and this book made me turn around and fall in love with her male characters once again. And falling for Cooper has made me a tiny bit obsessive with his personality and vibes, though his initial intensions made him a jerk, it's the slow realization that Mac is not like the other rich assholes, is what makes Cooper a man for loving her the way she is and defending her from his once awful friends. I am looking forward to see what else Elle has up her sleeves in this hopefully to be series. I need Evan's book, and pretty much everyone including Katie and Bonnie. I just know that she is going to write their story, and if she doesn't then oh well... But I am hoping that she does because it's a series to read for sure. With that being said, I am glad she strived with this romance because she did not disappoint in the least. And her OG readers will sure love this story as well and bring back the best kind of OFF CAMPUS vibes without the sports trope part of it.

"920","57693481","My toxic trait is knowing what to expect from a book, still reading it anyway, and then writing a review about the things I didn't like about the book which I expected. This was actually an okay read! Unfortunately, there was nothing that would make me claim that this book stands out from other books. I really liked Mackenzie though. She is a genuinely good person and such a boss! I enjoyed reading about how smart she was in securing financial independence for herself early on. There were struggles she had earlier in the book but we see some growth by the end. Yes, I enjoyed reading more about her than the romance in this book. In fact, I didn't really find any other character half as interesting.",3
"921","57693481","… Okay. Wow.Let me preface this by saying Elle Kennedy’s written some amazing books. The Deal was obviously perfection, not to mention my personal favorite, The Chase (Summer and Fitz, ugh, the best).I really, really thought I would love this one, but, unfortunately, very little worked for me in this story.The plot seemed to be inspired by After, meaning the hero, Cooper, a local to the small beach town of Avalon Bay, is dared by his friends to hook up with Mackenzie – the wealthy girlfriend of an even wealthier jackass named Preston who got Cooper fired – and basically rub it in Preston’s face (which, ew?).Eventually, Cooper falls in love with Mackenzie and just makes the decision not to tell her about the dare… ever. He tells all his friends the deal is off and never to tell her the truth about why he approached her in the first place. It was really infuriating, to say the least. Obviously, she should have all the information before making the decision to be with him, but treating Mackenzie like a child seemed to be the consensus between everyone in this book.I felt like Mackenzie herself acted very randomly throughout the story. She was a self-made millionaire at 20 (!) after creating a Reddit-like platform in high school where people posted funny stories about their partners. This was such a weird choice to me, considering a big part of the plot was her falling in love with an Avalon Bay hotel devastated by a hurricane and deciding renovate it. Why not make her online business something related to interior design or architecture or something? One thing had nothing to do with the other!The last thing I’ll say is that about 99% of the characters in this book read like caricatures, with overblown and unrealistic personalities. Cooper and Mackenzie’s parents were comically indifferent and/or selfish. Cooper himself had a giant chip on his shoulder about rich people in general, who apparently had all treated him and his family like shit over the years? I feel like this could have been written with a lot more nuance to make them all sound like real people.The thing is, the writing here didn’t work for me, neither did the characters or the plot. This is such a bummer review to write, because I really thought I would love this! 💔",2
"922","57693481","DNF @7%  i don't even have will power to just skim this book and then give a hate review. its just bad. boohoo you're poor boohoo ok? i've read enough reviews to know how this ends and its not good.",NA
"923","57693481","3.25 stars Good Girl Complex is a new adult/opposites attract romance by Elle Kennedy and I was so ready for it. I am such a fan of Elle Kennedy’s. In fact, I think her ‘Off-Campus’ series is my all time favorite sports series. When I saw the blurb and cover, I couldn’t wait. Unfortunately, this one missed the mark for me. Cooper is a ‘townie’ and Mackenzie is a rich student at the local college. The townies and the ‘clones’ don’t mix, but Cooper has a reason for wanting to get Mackenzie to be friends with him. The friendship eventually turns into so much more. But there are tons of obstacles between them, and her money is just a small part of it. I think my biggest problem with this book is that I found most of the characters unlikable. They had moments that I liked them, but more often than not, not only the main characters but also the secondary characters weren’t great. It’s hard when you don’t love/connect with the characters to love the story. Cooper’s twin brother Evan might have been my favorite. He really grew on me as the story progressed. Elle Kennedy’s writing is always fantastic and I enjoyed parts of this story, but overall it was just okay for me.",3
"924","57693481","OKAY HEAR ME OUT! was this book good? no, was it well written? absolutely not. but it was fun for the gurls and it reminds me of my wattpad days when my favorite trope was “bets” what can i say? i love liars! and this gave! this book reminds me of nathan and haley whomst i love so IDC ITS GOOD.  like i said this was so fun. it’s been a while since i’ve read a bad boy story and i’m absolutely obsessed with the hartley twins just like everyone else. this really reminded me of the fun that outerbanks had. honestly it reminds me of my favorite tropes that i loved growing up. rich girl x poor boy, bad boy trope, a bit of found family. the banter? man this couple had me laughing this whole book. the chemistry? perfect. elle kennedy you slick bitch, got me actually caring about this white ass couple. PERFECT summer read… for me at least.",4
"925","57693481","2.5 stars(warning, long review)I wanted to love this, but the synopsis didn't really explain the main premise of this book, which unfortunately, consisted entirely of tropes and story lines that I hate, so I went into this book with high hopes, only to be sorely disappointed. Additionally, I think I've just outgrown Elle Kennedy's writing style. Although I loved her Off Campus series, nothing since then (The Briar U spin off series included) has really impressed me. Although I was initially a little worried going into Good Girl Complex that I wouldn't like it, as I'm not a huge fan of of the ""good girl trope"" or ""poor boy rich girls"" romances, I had high hopes Elle Kennedy would put a new twist on these tropes. Much to my dismay, she somehow did the opposite. This book felt like a semi-problematic storyline from an early 2000's book/movie, not like something new from 2021. To further explain my thoughts, I'm going to give a little plot synopsis. SPOILERS AHEAD (all of this happens in the first 30 or so pages of the book, and it's literally the set up of the plot, but since it's not in the synopsis I'm putting a spoiling warning). Essentially the way this romance starts, is that Cooper, the love interest, meets Mackenzie's awful boyfriend cheating on her in a bar. The bf gets Cooper fired, so as revenge, Cooper uses Mackenzie as payback. Him and his entire group of friends make a bet to have Cooper sleep with Mackenzie and make her fall in love with him, wait for her to dump her boyfriend, and then publicly dump her. Personally, I hate the ""bet"" trope. I don't think it's a good set up for a romance when one character is literally using the other, but even on an objective level, this specific bet is really messed up. The way that Cooper and his friends address the bet, they act as if Mac is nothing but a body belonging to her boyfriend, and that by using and discarding her, it gets back at him and rich people as a whole. I understand that the bet is not supposed to be forgivable. It's the source of the conflict, but still, the way Cooper (at the start of the book) and his friends treat Mac is so vindictive and cruel, I didn't want to see Mac learn to love them, cause I felt like she deserved better. So much of this book was just sexism and unwarranted cruelty under the guise of ""class commentary"" and ""justified revenge"". I'm not even trying to defend the ultra rich, I'm just asking for characters to treat each other with basic respect. Mac was never mean to any of Cooper's friends, and I get that a lot of rich people like her had been, but still, she shouldn't have had to win them over and had a tragic home life backstory for them to treat her like a person. That should have been the default. It doesn't help that even aside from it's set up, I never fell in love with the romance in this book, or these characters. I have found that with other Elle Kennedy books, yes the characters and romance were strong, but a highlight of her writing was the way she naturally blended in so many well loved tropes (ie. fake dating and the one bed trope in The Deal). Unfortunately, in this book, it's just a combination of divisive and outdated tropes (using the girl for a bet, innocent rich girl x poor bad boy, ""not like other girls"" protagonist, cheating that's justified cause it's ""with the right person"", vindictive one dimensional ""ex-girlfriend of the love interest"" characters, etc). My final complaint is just that this book wrapped up really quickly. The resolution felt a bit rushed and there wasn't an epilogue. Overall, I really didn't enjoy this, and honestly, was pretty disappointed with it. There are definitely readers who will enjoy this, but I don't know if those readers are the ones this book is being marketed to. Although this is in no way a dark romance, I think some dark romance reader's may enjoy this, as the whole ""bad boy who initially uses a girl but falls for her"" trope and some of Copper's actions are more common in that genre, but this was definitely not for me. I think the main reason why that is because this book is very unlike any of the other's I've read from this author. Normally, Elle Kennedy's love interests are ""ideal book boyfriends"" who have a loveable group of friends, and are pining after their girl, so this was just really, unexpected. To wrap this review up, I don't want to put people off of reading this book, I just feel like the synopsis should have mentioned the bet, as there is definitely an audience for this book, I just don't necessarily think it's the audience that this book was primarily advertised to (fans of the Off Campus/Briar U series who are expecting something similar).Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for the eARC in exchange for an honest review.",2

   ➽ KITTY KATS CRAZY ABOUT BOOKS
When an altercation stirs up at 'Joe's Beachfront Bar' where Cooper is currently working at bartending and he takes on a 'clone' that's throwing unwanted advances at his close friend whose also bartending that night, Cooper takes it a wee bit too far and is dismissed on the spot. After doing a wee bit of digging his close group of friends concoct a plan to take the guy down a peg or two by stealing his girlfriend out from under him. 
   'I'm angry and bitter and itching for blood. Besides, I'd be doing this chick a favour rescuing her from Kincaid.'
 Enter twenty year old self made millionaire Mackenzie, she's been dating her boyfriend Preston Kincaid for four years, even though they ran in the same circle since they were kids. Lately Mackenzie has felt stifled, from her controlling parents to her predictable boyfriend.Meeting Cooper he awakens something within her, and once Cooper gets to really know Mackenzie and realises she's nothing like his preconceived thoughts about her type but has no idea how he's going to stop this plan from going ahead. This took me no time at all to read, small town rich college girl falls for the bad boy around the quant sea side town of Avalon Bay, as rule of thumb the 'Clones' and the 'Locals' do not mix generally. I also loved how how there wasn’t one of them, but two of them, twins to be exact, (The Hartley Twins) so I kind of hope Evan gets his own story.This was a cute when opposites attract, slow burn read which wrung all those Elle feels out of me which I haven’t felt for a while from this author. Not an overabundance of angst which is what this author usually gives us, but just enough to add some spice to it.",4

***There’s cheating in this book. Not in the main couple, the h makes out with the H while having a boyfriend*** ohhh okay, so I started this and wasn’t feeling it AT ALL. Idky, but the beginning felt too chaotic?? it was weird, but I kept going and started to get into it. What I liked:🤍the gangggg, at first I didn’t, but then they all became friends and I’m down for books for everyone. Hell yes. Evan and Daisy?!? bye i love them, best people in this world🤍how the feeling and tone changed. We went from childish college games, to more real life stuff and it was the best change🤍when Mac stepped up for herself, get it girl!!!🤍i liked the romance🤭 the beginning… yeah no, but once they caught feelings?? i liked it, it felt real? like not everything is rainbows and butterflies, i liked that What I didn’t like:~ first THE ENDING???!? WHY?!? it was so abrupt😩😩😩😩😩😩~ Mac hypocritical ass. She did grow and I liked her in the last bit, but how she was basically crucifying every “clone” in her head for cheating, just for her to do the same thing days later was… 🤡🤡🤡 ~ I liked Coop, I found him charming, sue me. But he was pretty stupid at times lmao. The fact that he kept lying really bothered me :/ and how he kept bitching about Evan and Mac’s being friends?!? ITS WHAT YOU WANTED STUPID STOP COMPLAINING~ everything felt unresolved?? Preston and Mac’s hotel… like? give me more?? Everything felt unfinished:(overall, I had a good time, I enjoyed it. Yeah it wasn’t perfect, but meh, I’m not too mad about it. Can’t wait for Evan’s book!!!!! GIMME IT

무제(無題)(Untitled, 2014) — G-DRAGON[2021]a new NA college romance by EK?? good girl/rich bad boy trope??? i need it. i need it NOW 😩",3
"928","57693481","This whole book felt like After fanfiction. The storyline is basically poor tattooed bad boy (Cooper) is fired from his bartending job bc he got in a fight with some rich guy. so to take revenge on the rich guy his friends propose a bet that he should seduce his girlfriend a.k.a the h (Mackenzie) who is ""the plain rich good girl"" to make her fall in love with him and leave her asshole bf and then publicly dump her. And ofc he thinks that's a great idea. Let's toy with some girl's feelings, what can go wrong?🙄 
  
    ""I’m not supposed to sleep with her unless she initiates, but if the chemistry sizzling between us is any indication, I suspect she won’t stop with a kiss. It’ll be a kiss that leads to the bed that leads to getting balls deep inside her. She’ll dump Kincaid faster than you can say game over. I win. Mission accomplished.""
  
 tbh immediately i wasn't big fan of this storyline. Didn't we leave this crap in 2010? Why is it still a thing in 2022?I feel like Elle Kennedy peaked with the ""off campus"" series but since then all of her new books are not good. Anyways this was a snoozefest. I debated dnf-ing at least 5 times but really wanted to see how it'd end so i skimmed the first half bc NOTHING HAPPENED. They start as friends with the H obv trying to make the h fall in love with him while she is still in a relationship. So they hang out as friends, rescue a dog, text all the time, lust for each other and other boring stuff. she's so unhappy with her life following her parents demands - finish college, marry the rich bf, have kids, be a housewife, you know all the normal rich ppl stuff🙄 her bf is a scumbag who cheats on her all the time but she has no idea. Honestly she was so clueless, how they were in a relationship for 4 years but she barely knew him was little unrealistic to me.so instead spending time with her bf she starts developing relationship with the H while in a relationship with her bf. I'm making sense right? Personally this is one of my pet peeves in romance books, dump your bf first bc i can't connect with their romance otherwise. he was always in the back of my mind popping out every time they had a cute moment. and of course she kisses him, then feels guilty and tells her bf. ohh and they don't break up right away.🙄 
  
    “I kissed someone. A guy.”He waits, watching me, as if I might say more.Is that all?” Preston prompts.“No. I mean, yeah. We only kissed, if that’s what you mean.” I bite my lip. Hard. “But I cheated on you.”Babe,” he says, squeezing my hand. He smiles, almost amused. “I’m not mad.”I blink. “You’re not?”“Of course not. So you had too much to drink and kissed a townie. Welcome to your freshman year of college. Guess you learned a lesson about handling your liquor.”
  
they finally break up past the 50% mark and she immediately has sex with Coop and they get together. Then there was some family drama with coop's mother and finally she learns the truth in the last 5%. His former fuck buddy tells her the truth but coop is so mad and blamed her. No you jerk you're the one to blame, he didn't even tell the girl their fwb relationship is over after he took the bet😤.I didn't have any sympathy for him, clueless asshole. 
  
    ""And that’s when I realize, as I feel the color drain from my face and guilt twist up my insides, that maybe I was the asshole."" 
  
Then he barely groveled, she forgave him. the end. The thing i like about her off campus series is actually the friendships between the guys and the girls but here i didn't like any of Cooper's friends. Coop's brother was disgusting manwhore pig and all of his friends were awful.Overall there wasn't anything i liked about this book.",1
"929","57693481","This is a story about a townie boy Cooper and a rich girl Mackenzie. Cooper wanted to get revenge on Mac's bf because Mac's bf did something to Cooper's friend and then Cooper was like I'm Cooper blah blah blah and no one can mess with me and my fucked up friends blah blah blah. So, he and his some fucked up friends made a very fucked up plan to make Mac fall in love with cooper🥰 How original right!? I know.And also, this girl had the audacity to say that her boyfriend is an asshole because he cheated on her (tbh he was an asshole) when she was literally throwing herself on Cooper even tho she already had that asshole boyfriend. They all were horrible in this book.I think the author wanted to give us something similar to OBX (I even hate to write about one of favourite shows here in this review 😭) but with a toxic mix of Cooper and Mackenzie, she failed miserably.This book reminded me of After series and no I haven't read that shit book but I have seen the movies. And Cooper and Mac both reminded me of Hardin and Tessa which made me hate this book even more.My first Elle Kennedy book and guess what? It was a horrible experience. Will try some of her other hyped books in future but that ain't happening any time soon.",2

Mac took a gap year to start her own business and she has made 7 figures, yet she promised her parents that if she could take a gap year, she would go to the college of their choice when it was over. The Hero(s): Cooper Hartley (a.k.a. Coop) - a bartender and a local in the seaside town of Avalon Bay near the upper crust Garnet College. Coop has a plan for his life, so when he gets fired because a guy named Preston basically threatened his boss, he decides to get back at Preston.The Story: Mackenzie is a good girl who basically does everything her parents say from dating the guy they like to going to college despite the fact that she is growing a successful internet business. So she is surprised to find that she is attracted to the first townie she meets when her and her roommate go out to a local bar.The narration on this one was terrific. It was dual POV and dual narration done by Ava Erickson and Joe Arden. Jo has the perfect gravely voice for Cooper Hartley, same for Ava as Mac. She has a soft and young sounding voice that is great for audiobooks and matched Mac completely. The story was fantastic as well. Elle Kennedy does new adult so well. I thought this would be the classic good girl and bad boy erotic romance and it was, but it was so much more. The bad boy wasn’t all that bad. Though he certainly could fight and has the terrific body and tattoos to go with the bad boy image. Mac was the good girl that just wants to be herself instead of the girl that always does what her loved ones tell her. I loved the side stories about group of friends, the townies versus clones (which is what the townies call all the rich college kids because they are all clones of each other and their parents), and Mackenzie’s parents and boyfriend. I don’t want to give away any more than that, but I listened to the entire book in one sitting and it held my attention the entire time. I voluntarily read & reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

"932","57693481","This wasn’t terrible, but I don’t think Elle Kennedy’s writing tone is really my vibe. I’m more into lighthearted rom-coms than Angsty Pining™ so this didn't really do anything for me if I'm being honest.

"933","57693481","As much as I love Elle Kennedy, and I still read anything this woman writes, this one was just fine for me. Cooper is a ‘tattooed bad boy’ who is plotting revenge against a ‘rich clone’ named Preston and wants to use Mac to do so. Mac is Preston’s girlfriend and is pretty content with her life. Until she meets Cooper..You see, Cooper is suppose to be a bad boy, but he’s actually a pretty sweet guy, who shows a lot of respect and support. He just made a stupid decision when he was angry but other than that, I’d choose him over Preston any day. ♡Anyway this book feels very 00’s romcom.(thanks SK for pointing that out, has been in my head ever since) The plot has been done quite a few times and it’s very predictable. Even though I enjoyed myself, I wouldn’t necessarily go for a reread. I was really hoping for ‘the Deal’ cuteness (or maybe ’the Mistake’, because that ones even better imo), but that didn’t really happen for me.",3

That’s basically what Good Girl Complex by Elle Kennedy did!This book was only my third contemporary this year that I finished! My first new adult romance in like forever and I’m so happy it met my expectations. In fact, this book gave me the same kind of feeling I had when I finished the Deal and you guys know how much I loved The Deal!Anyway…first off, we get to meet an entirely new set of characters. From trust fund kids to townies, this set of characters are familiar for those who loves NA romance but what I liked about this set of characters is the way Elle gave them each a personality, established connections, set rivalries that I hope is going to pay off in the future. *hint hint we need more books please!Second, Mac and Cooper. They are the stars. And like I mentioned before, Elle really took her time developing both characters, giving them personalities, hopes and dreams, and flaws, and character development. Which is often my frustration with a lot of NA romance. Yes, there’s heat but where’s the character development, huh?Well, in this book, you get all of it. You get the heat, chemistry. character and relationship development. And considering the relationship between Coop and Mac didn’t exactly start out with the best intentions on Cooper’s part. The motivation behind how they met and why is huge part of the plot so I won’t spoil but trust me, it’s not pretty. It’s a hard trope to pull off but Elle Kennedy did it and she gave me the resolution I wanted with a few surprises along the way.The only reason why it’s not a full 5 stars is that this book needed to have an epilogue!I won’t say more because I don’t want to spoil anything but add this to your TBR and read it as soon as it’s out.____________Oh wow!This gave me the same feeling I had when I finished The Deal and you guys know how much I loved The Deal. The tropes Elle employed were familiar but she made it fresh and she didn't neglect character growth for the two main characters which I loved.This book won't be out until next year but trust me, make this a priority on your #tbr!Full review to come...The Netgalley gods finally approved my request and I AM NOW READING IT!",4

Oh Elle Kennedy, how I've missed your writing. This book just hit all of the right spots for me, and I really do mean all of the right spots. I sincerely hope this is the start of an incredible new series because I'm seriously in love with the setting of Avalon Bay and all of the secondary characters introduced here. But I digress. Let's chat Good Girl Complex. Because, man I loved this book.This is your opposites attract, rich girl meets boy from the wrong side of the tracks but with a twist. Cooper and his twin brothers are guys with a definite rep in their town. Oh and icing, they're twins. Yep. You read that right. TWINS. But I digress again. Coop is sick and tired of the rich trust fund kids that flood their college town with their entitlement and egos. So when particularly vapid one causes trouble at the bar Coop bartends end, and it results with the kid throwing his weight around and Coop getting fired, he's pissed. He's beyond pissed. So what's a guy to do to get revenge? Why target the douchebag's equally rich and gorgeous girlfriend, get her to fall for him, so he can dump her and get to rub it in the rich a-holes face of course. DUH. But you know what they say about the best laid plans...Mac is the furthest thing from the stereotypical rich girl. She's only in college after a gap year to appease her parents who don't exactly support her entrepreneurial ways. It doesn't matter that Mac is the mastermind behind a website that made her a millionaire. All her parents want is for her to marry the right man like her equally rich boyfriend, and be the good little wife. Ah stereotypes. Coop and Mac meet and become fast friends. Mac is yearning for something more, and her life is slowly suffocating her. Coop allows her the freedom she's been unknowingly yearning for. And the chemistry between them? DELICIOUS.This is very much a slow burn, and as we slowly get to know each layer of these characters, we see the connection between them grow into something neither of them expected. Mac as she slowly acknowledges her attraction to Coop and grows into her own beyond the chains of her responsibilities. Coop as he realizes that what started as a bet is so much more. And this girl? Devoured every page of it.This is the New Adult gold in a way that only Elle Kennedy can write. It was opposites attract deliciousness that I devoured from cover to cover and left desperate for more. And while I would have loved an epilogue, I simply adored this book and these characters. There's so many secondary characters that I'm hoping get their own books in this town, including Coop's twin. If you're looking for an incredibly written New Adult romance, you seriously cannot miss this one.ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:",5

"941","101145836","dnf 30%The cover is giving 'Siblings or Dating?'────────Yeahhhhhhh, there's no way I'm continuing it, it's been three weeks since I started it so I definitely won't continue it. I wanted to give this author a chance when I saw a lot of people reading her books, because I like to have my own opinion, but the first thirty percent already convinced me that her stories are not for me. I actually should have stopped the second I read this.
  
    ""The latest in the TikTok sensation […]""
  
I learned that this is a bad sign, but whatever, I decided to continue. I think my main problem here is the writing. It's as if the author wrote this book specifically for Gen Z and TikTok users because this book has zero originality. And it's not that I have anything against people using this app, I literally have it on my phone. It’s just that it was painful to read. Some examples. 
  
    “God, Ryan. Don’t make me emotional when I’m about to head to a hockey party. You know being sad makes me horny.” 
  
I'm sorry, but that line looks like something out of some low-budget Netflix movie.
  
    ""How am I supposed to fake being confident with women in these conditions?""
  
I literally heard something similar to this quote on TikTok at least one hundred times. 
  
    ""I roll my hips against him. His eyes close, voice strains. “We’ll make it fit.”
  
Yep, I'm pretty sure I've read that sentence in at least ten books this year. 
  
    ""they all turn to watch us with interest. I keep my head held high and try to not let it show that I know this will be on the UCMH gossip page tomorrow.""""to not dwell on the fact I am once again on some shitty college gossip page, the girl I’m with""
  
Trust me, people don’t give an f who you are hooking up with. You are just a college student, not Taylor Swift to be on some ""gossip page"" for a hook up. 
  
    “Do you have a girlfriend?” My question catches him off guard, his mouth twists in confusion. “No?”“Your room is really clean.""
  
So a guy can't clean if he doesn't have a girlfriend? The heroine was annoying the shit out of me. 
  
    ""Here at Honey Acres we have a zero-fraternization policy, which if breached will result in contract termination.""
  
Oh no. Soo forbidden. You literally work at a summer camp, most people just dgaf.I'm not rating this book, even though one star looks really promising and I almost moved my finger towards it, but I've only read thirty percent of it, so it wouldn't be fair.

Because they can’t be together due to camp rules, they decide to be “friends.” Which doesn’t last very long. Then comes the sneaking around. One of the things I loved about this book was the big friend group and found family vibes. It’s one of my favorites tropes and Hannah does that so well.Russ is absolutely obsessed with Aurora, but I felt like her immaturity really held this one back for me. Where Nate and Stassie were more emotionally mature and highly communicative, Aurora and Russ literally call themselves miscommunicators—because it kept happening. Aurora’s behaviors of acting out and attention seeking got old for me and she kept pointing out that’s her go-to because of her…daddy issues. Russ was so wholesome and just a good bean, though. I just with we got more character growth from her. Don’t go in expecting Icebreaker 2.0 because this is not it. It takes place nearly entirely at summer camp with zero hockey, so if you’re expecting a hockey romance pls adjust your expectations! Hannah is an amazing writer and weaves in emotional themes coupled with humor, lightheartedness, and steam, and Wildfire hits the same way as Icebreaker did in those ways. The characters are vibrant and funny, and I honestly loved Russ as I knew I would. Thank you sm to Atria and Hannah for an arc 🫶TWParental addiction Parental abandonment/neglect",4
"949","101145836","The TikTok sensation surrounding this book is well-deserved, as it perfectly captures the book's vibe and allure. I must admit that while I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hannah Grace's Icebreaker, this book surpassed my expectations and became an instant favorite. Even the cover is irresistibly cute! Returning to Maple Hills feels like coming home, and I eagerly anticipate catching glimpses of my beloved characters, playing a guessing game as to who will take the lead in the next installment (I constantly debate between JJ and Steve).What sets this book apart is the remarkable chemistry between Russ and Rory, who are truly meant for each other. Both characters carry the weight of their family issues, particularly those related to their fathers. The contrasting ways in which they cope with their problems are artfully portrayed, with Rory's directness and willingness to express her frustrations juxtaposed against Russ's tendency to bury his feelings behind self-erected walls. Yet, they find solace and support in each other, gradually unburdening themselves of their past and forging a deep connection. I wanted nothing more than to wrap these endearing characters in a warm embrace. They are refreshingly authentic, displaying vulnerability beneath their tough exteriors and demonstrating maturity in tackling their challenges while cautiously allowing their hearts to open, despite the risk of getting hurt.The story of Aurora, or Rory as she's affectionately known, and Russ unfolds at a campus party, reminiscent of the first installment. Rory attends the party at the insistence of her best friend Emilia, lured by the promise of veggie pizza. Little did she expect to encounter the introverted yet charismatic Russ Callaghan, a man of few words, who captivates her. After a night of revelry, including a playful game and an intimate lap dance, Rory abruptly retreats, convinced that Russ's prolonged absence from the bathroom indicates disinterest. Unbeknownst to her, Russ believes he's out of her league and resigns himself to her sudden departure.Fate, however, reunites them at the same summer camp, where they coincidentally find themselves working as counselors, seeking respite from their respective family troubles. As they discover their shared workplace, their already complicated connection intensifies. Compounded by the camp's strict policy against fraternization, Russ becomes even more hesitant, fearing the consequences of jeopardizing his job. Nonetheless, the magnetic attraction between him and Rory becomes irresistible, fueling their desire to explore the undeniable chemistry that binds them.Rory carries the weight of her mother's incessant complaints and guilt trips following her parents' divorce, while her father chooses to ignore her existence. She also grapples with an estranged relationship with her older sister, who resides overseas. On the other hand, Russ faces financial hardships stemming from his father's gambling addiction. Pressure mounts as his father continually requests money, and when Russ refuses, he faces verbal abuse. He is frustrated by his mother's constant justifications for his father's behavior and his brother's insistence that he prioritize family time despite being the one on tour with his band.Their relationship may have begun with a passionate night, but I relished the gradual development of their connection. The slow burn progression, the strengthening of their friendship, and their shared vulnerability allowed them to shed their emotional barriers and learn to trust one another. What truly captivated me was the absence of unnecessary immaturity or exaggerated drama. Instead, the story presented two individuals navigating their complex circumstances with maturity, drawing strength from each other.I cherished the personal growth of these characters as they navigated their way through their dysfunctional families, always supporting one another unconditionally and offering a safe haven amidst the chaos. Witnessing their journey was a joy, as they discovered their own paths while building bridges with their loved ones.Overall, this book has firmly secured its place as my favorite in the series, leaving me eagerly anticipating future installments set in the enchanting world of Maple Hills. The author, Hannah Grace, has once again demonstrated her talent for crafting compelling stories filled with relatable characters and heartfelt emotions.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me with the opportunity to read and review this swoon-worthy book. Their generosity in sharing the digital reviewer copy in exchange for my honest thoughts is sincerely appreciated. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all romance enthusiasts and fans of the Maple Hills series.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
"950","101145836","ೃ⁀➷ 3.5 stars *ੈ✩‧₊˚Going into this book I was kinda nervous since it has one of my least favourite tropes (the ONS) but imo the author really showed their romantic progression and did justice to their relationship.It fell a little flat for me bc I couldn’t get as invested in this book. Maybe it was the slump idk. It was really enjoyable don’t get me wrong, I just couldn’t connect to the story the way I wanted. It was nice seeing how they would interact and behave with each other. Them sharing their thoughts and communicating was so healing, i think that was my favourite part of the book. When they wouldn’t give each other up and fought to stay together. Russ was adorable. When he would blush It was the qewtest shit everrr 🤭🤭 I liked his growth in the book and how he learns to open up. His nervousness and insecurity was honestly so sexy 🫦Aurora delivered on the sunshine for sure. She had Russ wrapped around her finger as she should 💅If ur looking to this book for something like icebreaker then ur gna be disappointed bc it’s not a sports romance. This is more about the characters growing individually and together in a completely different setting for most of the book. But it’s still got the author’s signature fluffy romance, found family/friendship and spice <3𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I like that she’s set up some sort of backstory for Xander and I need his book rfn but it’s okay I’ll take it if Henry’s comes first 😙─── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──It’s here and I’m ready to eattt ***1/10/23 — two more dayssssss 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️***UPDATE 30/3/23: THE COVER IS GORGEOUS OMFDSSS ***Russ bby I’m waiting for you <3",3

"953","101145836","I was wondering if this one was going to be a hit or miss and, ugh, it's a miss for sure.The plot is worst than icebreaker and, if you read icebreaker, you know that is saying a lot. At least with icebreaker there was decent 🌶️, but wildfire was meh. I found both Russ (MMC) and Rory (MFC) super annoying. They are extremely insecure to the point that is exhausting to read and in the end we see no development in the matter, they just end up insecure together lol. There were so many new characters! The first couple of chapters were so hard to read and keep up with, I think for a romance this is unnecessary but that is personal opinion.

  “We’re not miscommunicators, Russ. We share our secrets.”
 made me so mad??? not sharing secrets when you’re not ready doesn’t necessarily make you a miscommunicator!! i also felt pretty bad when she asked him to take her to bed just so she could feel wanted. it was heartbreaking to see how she constantly needed validation, especially male validation, because of her daddy issues (her dad is an asshole). she’s hella witty though, i’ll give her that. i absolutely loved how rory joined the friend group after becoming russ’s girlfriend, and i’m honestly very jealous. i would love to be part of the friend group too 😭overall, i really enjoyed the summer camp trope 🏕️ and i’m so excited for henry’s story!! 💜pre-read:reading this because i love russ 😙💘🔥",4

"960","101145836","Writing: acceptable | Plot: floofy | Ending: happy  SYNOPSIS Russ and Aurora tackle their daddy issues over the summer.  MY OPINION If you're shocked at this rating, let me explain. Hannah Grace calls herself a ""fluffy comfort book"" author, so that's the lens I'm reviewing it through. If you read this and dissected it like you would a book about genocide, you're doing yourself a disservice. This book's objective is clearly to put a cheesy smile on your face and let you escape from the very real cost of living crisis and the fact pumpkin-flavoured Philadelphia cream cheese is nearly $10 at your local grocery store.I've never read Icebreaker so I can't compare the two but the streets seem to think Icebreakers is better. If you're looking for a slow burn, keep on looking. This is on-demand hot water. Homegirl has three orgasms in the first 10% of the book. Which leads me to my next point... I know this is suppose to be fluffy and comforting, but it felt like an inexperienced 16-year-old boy wrote the sex scenes. Can we stop pretending that finishing MULTIPLE times in one session and from straight penetration is a REGULAR occurrence in big ole 2023? The spice was the equivalent of black pepper IMO. I just didn't feel any tension other than Aurora going OH EM GEE HE'S SOOO SEXY!!! And I can't buy into that he was saying all sorts of filthy stuff but got a boner while hugging her and had to psyche himself up in the mirror to talk to her like Bruce Willis from that one Friends episode. Other than that, this was fine. She did throw in some serious issues like alcoholism, gambling, and bum ass fathers. There's NO third-act breakup (sorry not sorry for the spoiler) which is great. There even were some funny moments (the possum scene...) Also, I highly recommend reading with your eyeballs; I had the ALC from Libro.fm but the narrators sounded so childish and somehow cheapened the book lol. If you want to read this, go ahead, but don't feel inspired to just because of my review haha. This won't blow your mind. If you want a fluffy, comfort read and don't mind closed door vibes, I strongly recommend anything from Lindsey Kelk.  PROS AND CONS Pros: some funny moments, light-hearted but does cover some serious topics with empathy, quick read, no third-act breakup, limited miscommunicationCons: did her mom actually steal someone's cat???? if so, that's absolutely fked LOL, no tension, spice was uninspired (at least no dry humping though), limited banter, pretty much insta-love___Check out my YouTube and my TikTok",3

I really loved her for that.Also she was so damn relatable like:""Why are you so cute?""We both had the same first impression of Russ.And like this one's just self explanatory:""The english major in me cringes at the cracked spine and folded page corners""Then we have Russ (muffin) Callaghan. Lemme tell you he was teh sweetest cinnamon roll ever and muffin as a nickname was so cute. Don't get me wrong I love bad boys and all but Russ really changed my perspective on that because he was so damn cute and caring and I loved how kind and loving he was. Not him pouring while being grumpy. He was so shy and anxious around aurora like this one scene where Aurora asks him for a secret to which he says:“You make me nervous,” he says eventually, immediately taking a swig of his beer.“That isn’t a secret,” I laugh. “That’s very obvious.”Also another plus point, that guy has DIMPLES. So if you don't like muffin I will be judging you.The romance was romancing,it had angst and forced proximity and so much cuteness. Idk how I'm still alive but I absolutely loved it.Now the the thing I want to talk about is *Henry* that man is easily the standard. He paints??? And he's cute and CUTE. I don't think anyone can beat Henry from maple hills and istg I will riot if the next book isnt about him. *We also got a very weird but a tad bit spicy Henry scene* (very smol tho)🥹🙃*I got an arc from love notes PR through netgalley in exchange for a honest review*AND ITS OUT!!!

  “What’re you doing?”“I’m watching you go in so you don’t have to watch me leave.”
One of the best things about Hannah Grace's books are the MMCs written by her. They all are green flags with the most caring, respectful and selfless personality. This was the cutest book and definitely better than Icebreaker! I mean what are the chances that two people who have daddy issues fall in love with each other? That's exactly what Russ and Aurora are. I love them and they are just so cute and adorable in this book and I adored each and every moments of them together even though the plot was a bit boring. I loved the confident girl x shy boy trope! Like you all I did not expected to blush everytime Russ was blushing. If someone who can make me like insta love/lust it's Hannah Grace. 
  “Well, green is my favorite color.”“What type of green? Ogre green?”“Whatever shade your eyes are.” 
Aurora and Russ are two broken people with daddy issues and they found each other exactly the moment they needed someone who could hold them and accept them and want them as who they were. It was beautiful to watch them grow together and help each other with their insecurities. The way Russ made sure that Rory felt wanted and loved and the way Rory made him realised that he did not need to hide his real self and she will accept him as who he is. The are the epitome of ""I can fix her/him"" trope and they did fixed each other lol. I also loved how they both refuse to be the misscommunicators in their relationship. That's what we call healthy relationship! Russ and Aurora maybe different because of their personality but they are also so similar when it comes to their insecurities and fears and that's what makes them even more perfect.
  “If you could go back in time and change something, what would you change?”“Nothing.” “Nothing? You wouldn’t change mistakes you’ve made or even, like, exams you could have done better on or something?” He shakes his head. “Seriously, nothing?” “Have you heard of the butterfly effect?” “I am familiar with butterflies, yes.”“What effect do they have on my time machine?” “Not butterflies, the butterfly effect. If I change one thing in my past, it’d cause a ripple effect, and I wouldn’t chance not meeting you.”
➸ Aurora Roberts  is a confident girl who seeks validation and acceptance because ofcource she has daddy issues (I feel you girl) I loved her and I liked how she accepted herself the way she is in the end and even stood up for herself against her asshole father. What I most loved about her is that once she got comfortable with Russ she tried her best to share her feelings and her insecurities with him and not only.
  “What if we get caught in the rain? You don’t get rainbows at night.”“You don’t need rainbows when you have the northern lights,” she says softly.
➸ Russ Callaghan the man you are 🤌🏻 He had me blushing and giggling all the damn time. The sweetest, caring and selfless man ever. He's just so perfect and he fake confident to impress Aurora was just adorable lol. He may be a shy man who keeps to himself and gets pink ears everytime Aurora says something flirty to him but he's also a confident man once he knows what he wants in his life. The way he made Aurora felt seen and loved made me love him even more.
  “You’re like sunlight, Rory. I want to bask in everything you have.”
The ending was good with no third act breakup and misscommunication! I never expected Russ's dad to become better for his son but atleast he's doing better and even treated Rory as his own daughter. The found family trope in the end with all their friends was amazing. I can't wait to see who else is getting their book in this series but first I want Henry's book!
  “It’s no secret that I love books. I love stories about people I don’t know, and places I haven’t been to. I’ve lived a thousand lives between a thousand pages, but no story, no life, no page has ever made me as happy as you do, Russ Callaghan.”",3

This book takes place at summer camp, where the main characters, Russ and Aurora, find themselves as camp counselors after having a one night stand at a college party. They thought they would never see each other again and then they both show up to be counselors at the summer camp and they realized the other person is there. It's like fate brought them back together in this exciting and unexpected way! 🏕✨ I loved that this was set at summer camp. It really does add a fun and exciting element to the romance. I felt there was no plot... But vibes were great. Hannah Grace portrays the concept of found family so well in this book. And it's great that some characters from the first book make appearances.I love how they learn to lean on each other/ become more open about personal things about their own lives it makes the the story that more realistic.Russ was such a sweet and relatable character. It's great to see him grow and work on his confidence throughout the book. I'm sure many readers will relate to his journey and find it endearing💕 .Aurora recklessness was relatable due to her upbringing. I just wanted to give her a big hug🫂. I totally feel her struggles and insecurities, which add depth to her character. 10/05 .i'm so ready for this 😊���️🔥☀️",3

"968","101145836","In case you thought Icebreaker was an anomaly, let its sequel disabuse you of that notion: you’re into books about 20 year old hockey players now. You don’t have to like it, you just have to accept it. This one is set in a summer camp where all the men are anti-toxicity and they cuddle puppies. Consent clogs the air and the MMC refuses to bang without a condom. There is a miscommunication trope — my least favorite — which is resolved within fifty pages and then openly mocked in a move that almost breaks the fourth wall.Look, I’m upset too. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. I wasn’t supposed to love books about people whose prefrontal cortexes aren’t yet fully developed falling in love over s’mores but it is what it is, babycakes, and Rory’s nervous babbling was far too relatable so you know what I give up I just love this series give it to me in liquid form so I can down it like a shot.",5

  “For all the romance books I've read and all the happy endings I've enjoyed, I can't imagine my own. I'd like to hope I'll have one, but hope can be dangerous.”
Welcome to another review!! I was so excited about this book because I loved the first one, but clearly, I set my expectations far too high…About the plot: This is the story of Rory (Aurora) and Russ. They meet during a party and because of a drinking game, they end up spending the night together. However, Aurora slips away while Russ is in the bathroom. Little did they know, they both decided to spend their summer away from Maple Hills and now they’re forced to work in the same place which has a strict “no staff fraternizing” rule. Russ must respect the rules since he needs this job, but Rory’s never been one for rules. My thoughts:I feel the need to start by saying that I am a romance girly to the very core and I don’t know if I don’t like this book as I expected it to please me because 1) I am slowly becoming a fantasy girly or 2) this book is just mediocre. In my defense and in defense of this book, the previous one I read was Divine Rivals, so that might be the reason? That said, I don’t hate this book. The story was nice, the characters were mediocre, but there were parts where nothing happened and, on the other hand, I feel like the end was a bit hasty. When I read the epilogue, I was too stunned to speak after seeing ""nine-ish years later"". I mean what the fuck??? What happened???Also, their daddy issues were just too much, I mean I have daddy issues myself, but I don’t talk about them every damn minute of my damn life? Most of the book was about the problems and difficulties Russ and Rory had with their dads, and it was def too much that I skipped a lot of paragraphs at the end. I don’t know what happened between Rory and her family and Russ with his. I just skipped because I was too exhausted about their problems that I couldn’t wait to finish it. I think that my dislike for this book is because the author had the need to repeat herself 30 times because otherwise it’d have been a 100 pages book. And I hate when people say the same thing repeatedly and I'm a very good listener- The writing was simple and easy to understand, nothing special and I underlined really few quotes but sometimes it was funny. If you're expecting it to be as hot as the first one, bestie I have to tell you that the smut scenes were few and poorly written... I'm sorry for all the smut girly out there!The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is the mention to Formula 1 which was appreciated. Russ: I really like him overall, he was sweet and respectful, he treated Rory in the best way. He was a good friend and overall, a really good guy. And at first, I wanted to hug him because he was so cute, but then I wanted to shake the hell out of him while screaming wake the fuck up!!!!! I like when I guy is shy and respectful but— once again— TOO MUCH!!!!! Tho I love the fact that he was so sweet with the kids and especially with the dogs!!Rory: she was a pain in the ass for most of the time, the classic spoiled pick me girl which I hate. And she was also horny most of the time, like girl get a grip on yourself Jesus! She kept calling Russ’ dick pretty??? Ugh, I can’t with this girl. I have nothing else to say about her. Other characters: Xander was funny and I like his friendship with Russ. Emilia was just useless in this story, but I like the fact that the author talked about her relationship with Poppy. Clay was useless too. And Maya—I forgot she existed during the whole book. The rest of them was boring asf.Quotes: ""I'm watching you go in so you don't have to watch me leave.""""If we get caught in the rain, we'll just enjoy the rainbow?""""I learned a long time ago that if I didn't put myself first, nobody else was going to. Forgiving people who repeatedly let you down is like sticking your hand in a fire over and over and expecting it to not keep burning you.""""You get that way when you know how fucking special someone is. How they have no goddamn idea how much brighter they make everything. You're like sunlight, Rory. I want to bask in everything you have.”“Nothing seems good enough. Nothing quite tells her how mesmerized I am by her. """"You are the brightest thing in my life, Aurora. And you're a living reminder of the good things that can happen when I allow myself to be happy.""""It's no secret that I love books. I love stories about people I don't know, and places I haven't been to. I've lived a thousand lives between a thousand pages, but no story, no life, no page has ever made me as happy as you do, Russ Callaghan.""Do I recommend this book?

I want to read icebreaker all over again now.😭This book had no plot, just vibes and an insane amount of good character development. We get to see how Halle and Henry both struggle with their studies and socializing. Struggling with their own personal issues and get better—it was nice to read it all, but after a while it fell off. RomanceListen, everything was excellent. Nothing too excellent. Something was missing. I saw their relationship, but I never sensed a romantic one between them. It was really cosy and friendly! There was hardly any tension between them at all. They were afraid to express their feelings to one another for sixty percent of the book. But even after they got together, I didn't find myself longing for them. 🥲Also that tutor x jock ... ...? this trope? hello? where?I feel like both of them had so many of their own issues. I get it, but still, this felt like they were trying to overcome their own struggles, with a side of romance.I also felt like the convos they had were more like therapy rather than yk the way couples talk. IDK how to explain it, a few times it's okay, but whenever they talked, all they discussed was there issues, and it was just too much..Side characters were same old. The girls group Halle found was SO PRECIOUS. Ugh, need me a girls group like in this one! The sibling-relationship between Anastasia and Henry made me tear so hard!!! 😭 
  Henry always says he’s glad he’s an only child without realizing he has a younger sister in Aurora and an older sister in Anastasia.
CharactersI had no idea Henry had such a complex personality, yk? Similar to the first novel, we got a peek of a very polished to perfection, well-informed person who looked out for everyone around him. However, it was heartbreaking to witness his internal conflicts. With these two MCs, Hannah was able to precisely represent my entire personality. Being a captain put a lot of pressure on Henry, who suffered greatly from ADHD. As I saw him battle to keep up with everyone, I wanted to just step in and give him a bear hug. 😭 
  “Is this okay? If I touch you here?” I ask her when my hands grip her waist gently, She nods, mouth skimming my ear when she leans in so I can hear her. “You don’t need to ask me.” “I do. I should. Men should.”
But even with all those issues, he still managed to be a gentleman with Halle 😭. It's all those small moments!! He made her a whole AUDIOBOOK! A FREAKING BOOK OF JUST HER PAINTINGS! GAH.He is the most gentlemanly gentleman to ever exist in the gentlemen world.
  He sits in his chair again, eyebrows pinched. “I’m sorry.”I lift my nose from the bouquet. “What for?” ""For being the first person to buy you flowers.”
Halle ✋🏻 THE LIFESAVER YOU ARE!!! She was running the whole family!!
  I hate feeling like I’m everyone’s mom when all I ever want when I call is my own mom. Being the eldest daughter is a curse and I’m sick of it.”
First of all, the way first child representation was represented!!! MARVELOUS *APPLAUD*God, her being the elder sibling, simply hit too close to home. She had to take care of EVERYTHING, even everyone's emotions! From assisting with homework to organising trips and such. Her character growth was the best. It was reassuring to see her say no to people. From not being a people pleaser to simply loving herself. The conversation she had with her mother was satisfying 😮‍💨. I was relieved that her mother didn't yell at her, but instead explained the situation to her. Then saying the words that Halle wanted to hear. 🤌🏻🥹The writingWas normal, easy to read. Nothing too complicated. But my main issue was those long ass dialogues! Like they be talking in these paragraphs 😭 and I don't think ppl do that a lot. In every scene where they talked- they talked a LOT with almost no pauses idk how to explainI remember reading Icebreaker, and even tho it didn't have plot, it had fun! The group of boys and those small moments made it so good. But in this, it's all these two characters finding themselves and fighting with their issues, like no parties, no group chats (just a few), almost no banter🥲 I missed it all. I DESPERATELY MISSED JJ, NATE AND EVERYONE 😭Overall it was a cute, very light, enjoyable and a comfort reas. Probably won't ever reread it but still it was a great experience. 🥹*****HALLE JACOBS What’s the code for when you get home and your ex, his family, and your parents have let themselves into your house?

It’s hard to explain.” “Remind me not to paint you anything. I have a feeling you’re a harsh critic.” -- meanwhile henry... After many chapters “What do you want to do?” I ask, taking off his sweatshirt that I stole. Henry stands from the floor, pushing his sweatpants down until he’s only in his boxers. “I want to take off all your clothes, cover you in paint, and fuck you right here on the floor,” he says, pointing to the center of the canvas. “Respectfully, of course.”-----Ugh I've got A LOT to say about this-- good/bad way!!!!!RTC _____ITS OUT.KAHSKSHAKBDShe is his private tutor.....👀😏🤌THE COVER!?

"971","199798652","3.65“This might be my favorite romance book, but we’re my favorite love story.”
This was shocking for me because it's a Hannah Grace book and I tend to enjoy her books, its not like I didn't enjoy this because I did enjoy it. It's just that it was so meh if you compare it to Icebreaker or Wildfire both of the books had a spark that this one was lacking. Okay so, my ritual while reading a Hannah Grace book starts with leaving your criticizing mind out, by setting your expectations to spicy fluffy romance with minimal plot. It's safe to say it did help me out at times. 
  “God, you sound like your parents right now. People can enjoy reading and still maintain a healthy attachment to reality, Will,” I drawl. “I’m not a social pariah because I like fiction.”
I feel like nothing much happened with the romance in this one?? I am glad that Huda warned me about it but I was like halfway through the book when I saw her saying this lol so I'm a little bummed out about that, My expectations were through the roof when I picked this book up because I had been waiting for Henry's book since I first read Icebreaker and to see got his route made me both sad and mad. Like, dont get me wrong I enjoyed it but I wanted MORE!! Hannah's writing style is very easy to adapt to, it's light and it's easy to read + it's also gripping at times but I feel like for a romance this was very long! like one thing that I liked about the books in the maple hills series was their length becuase it was the perfect length for a romance and seeing that this was 500 was not it for me. The story could hav easily wrapped up on pagee 400 so I dont know why the the next 100 pages existed. I might be critical but I did enjoy the 400 pages lol dont get me wrong I did.
  “Don’t do something you don’t like for other people.”
Henry, he is literally the greenest flag like I have read 700+ books and i have not met a man who scream green flag more than Henry did. He was perfect in so many ways, so respectfula dn so caring the way he noticed tiny details and focused on them and made everyone feel comfortable and learned from his mistakes and did better so other wont be harmed. I also liked his internal struggle as a hockey captain and the way he leaned into support from Anastasia and Nate was so cute, I like how they dealth with it.
  “You’re the period of calm after a storm or, like, I don’t know, a well-fed panda.”
Halle was a nice surprise as well, I liked her! she was shy, read audiobooks at the speed of 2x and was a massive fan of happy place, so everything was perfect when it came to her ohh she also was in a book club! I liked her monologue and her scenes with Henry made the book so much more interesting. I hated her boyfriend and I loved how she dealt with him and I am a sucker for angry confessions so her conversation with her mother was so satisfying.
  “I didn’t know what you like. Anastasia said sunflowers and Aurora said peonies, but I remembered you have a pink dress with tiny daisies on it so I thought they might be your favorite.”
Now the most disappointing part of this book was the romance, they were in love with each other but in denial?? and this went along for so long and tbh I dont even wanna talk about it because it was meh, like the scenes between them were cute but overall I wanted more also was shocked that the spice level was low as compared to the first one. I feel like I was just frustrated with it and it messed with my enjoyment for itOverall, an enjoyable read but also a lackluster read if you compare it to the first two.___HENRY 🙏🏻 PLS GET ME OUT OF THIS ROMANCE SLUMP 🙏🏻__After a little bit of searching I found someTROPES:• Opposites attract• Fake dating 🤭• FMC tutors the MMC• Forbidden love• Dual pov • Hockey team captain x book lover 💜• Spice~~~I wanna say told you so but 🤭 I'll let y'all pass.

The cover reveal is in two days 🙈 we saw a sneak peek and HENRY looks so cute he's even wearing a white shirt with his name on it and two hockey sticks whilst holding a book 😭 I WANT~~~If we get a cover tmrw or in the following week I am literally going to die because considering how cute the covers have been for the past two books I'm pretty sure Henry's book's gonna ace it as well. ~~~EVERYONE, WE DID IT!!This book is officially Henrys and the love interest is Hale. The official blurb is so cute 🙈. (18+ content 😏)~~~Done with wildfire. This is definitely Henry's because we got hints 🤭~~~Halfway through the second one and I am 110% sure that this is Henry (or I'm just delulu) but pls 🥺🙏~~~HEY! YOU BETTER BE HENRYS 😤",3
"972","199798652","This book was really cute! Henry and Halle are such sweet characters and have such a healthy and heartwarming relationship. Buttt I wanted to feel more towards the romance and towards the book in general. I do think a lot of people will like this book if you enjoy a feel-good romance with relatable characters and not much conflict with the relationship. But for me I wanted more angst or passion or tension or conflict or something. I will say! The characters did have conflict in their personal lives and I really enjoyed those plot lines. I found Halle and her people-pleasing very relatable. And Henry is neurodivergent which impacts his life in so many ways from his relationships to his schooling. I really enjoyed reading and learning about Henry.Overall though I liked Icebreaker and Wildfire a lot more. Very cute and sweet romance though!",3

  ""Thank you for being on my team, Henry.""""Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.""""And how does it make you feel? Now that you can picture it?""""Like I'm living in my daydreams. So, pretty damn happy.""
i know i said this book was going to get me out of my slump, but funny enough, i got out of it before even starting the book 😂 still, i’m sure it would’ve gotten me out of a slump if i were in it. anywayyy, i absolutely loved the first half and couldn't stop reading. i don’t know what i was on, but i was giggling and kicking my feet 🤭 however, when i picked it up again the next day to finish, i felt like i’d lost some of that initial excitement (though the book was still good). it’s kind of crazy how quickly my mood can change, but overall, i still really enjoyed the book. ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ halle the eldest daughter in the family, the “family manager”, and a total people pleaser. halle is easily my favourite fmc in this series so far. she’s so sweet, loving, and caring, and i honestly have 0 complaints about her. i teared up when she finally confronted her mom. no one realized just how much she was struggling inside. i’m really glad her mom listened, understood her, and made an effort to be better. i know her mom only had good intentions and wanted what was best for her, and it goes to show that people won’t know what you’re going through unless you tell them. as someone who used to be a people pleaser, i really empathized with halle. i understand how emotionally draining and frustrating it is to constantly put others' needs ahead of your own, thinking that the only way to be liked is by making everyone else happy.ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ henryhenry is such a gentleman and a sweetheart, and we definitely need more men like him in the world 😫
  “I would have shaved my legs if I’d known you were about to pay extra attention to them.”“It isn’t surprising for me to find hair in a place where hair grows, Halle. You haven’t shattered any illusions for me that women are smooth and hairless.”""...I need you to talk to me if you feel like I'm not stepping up, because I will. I'll do anything for you, Halle. I just don't always know it because sometimes that isn't how I think. I get wrapped up in things and then I don't focus on the outside things I want to focus on. You are a high priority to me.""""Look, I know hockey is your thing or whatever, but... have vou ever considered a professional career in carnival games? Because you're really annoyingly good. And don't tell me you're good at everything, because not every guy can just walk up to a game and win it.""""If he wanted to, he would.""
 you are absolutely right henry 🗣️🗣️🗣️i appreciated the neurodivergent representation in this book. when things got too overwhelming, he struggles to process his emotions and shuts down. he isolates himself, shuts everyone out, feels guilty later, and then spirals even more. he doesn’t understand why he’s like that or know how to stop it, but really wants to, and honestly, i’m exactly the same, so i really empathized with him as well. ᡣ𐭩.ᐟ halle and henryi loved how comfortable henry was around halle, and watching them slowly fall in love was just heartwarming 🥹🥹🥹
  “I like talking to you more than I like talking to almost anyone.”""What're you daydreaming about?""You. Always you. ""Telling Bobby that he has to give up his seat in your car because of your massive duck and it's friends.""
i especially loved how they constantly reassured each other. halle was so understanding, and the way she validated his emotions and feelings was incredibly sweet 🥹 she even helped him with his studies, bought him noise cancelling headphones, etc., which was so thoughtful 😭 henry is just as understanding. i appreciated how he constantly reassured her and reminded her that she didn’t need to apologize, feel bad, or be embarrassed for no reason. i also loved how communicative, self-aware, respectful, observant, and honest he was. i also appreciated that they didn’t rush their relationship and only did it about 70% into the book. it was so sweet how slow and gentle he was with her, knowing it was her first time 😭
  ""What would you do? If you wanted to charm me?""""I'd tell you how fucking beautiful you are. That when you laugh I want to listen to it forever. I'd tell you that when I daydream, I think of us. And all the things I want us to do. And all the things I want to do to you.""""I think that would definitely work.”
the found family trope in this series is one of my favourites, and i’m so glad henry and halle were surrounded by people who truly understand and support them 🥹
  ""I don't like being captain.""""Then why do it? Why not just step down?""""I didn't want to let you all down. You all believed in me.""""Fucking hell, Henry. We believe in you because we love you, you fool. You could tell us you wanted to start, I don't know, fucking show jumping and we'd believe in you. You don't need to be something that makes you unhappy for us.""“My instincts are telling me to say I don’t need their help, that I’ll do it all on my own. But in reality, that isn’t what I want. I need help and I need support, and having a group of friends who offer that is what I’ve always wanted.This whole time I’ve craved more superficial experiences like shopping and getting ready together. I’ve called it girlhood because to me it represented what I missed growing up. What younger Halle desperately wanted. But as we’ve grown closer and our lives have intertwined, I know I was so wrong. This is sisterhood. This is women supporting other women to meet their goals. This is what I’ve yearned for, and I didn’t even know.”“The most important thing that this whole project had taught me is that putting myself first doesn’t mean that I have to do it alone. Having people to help and cheer me on while I did this thing for myself is what made it actually enjoyable in the end.”
overall, this is my favourite book in the series, and i hope we get JJ’s story next <3

"981","199798652","The Maple Hills series keeps growing on me as the author delivers an even better new book that I fell hard for! I've had a soft spot for my sweet boy Henry since the series began, and as soon as I received my ARC, I was over the moon. But expressing excitement at work has its consequences—like when colleagues walk in unannounced and catch you mid-handspring, causing you to lose balance, hit your knee on your favorite rolling chair, and land on the floor in a split! No exaggeration, something close to that happened to me. But it was totally worth it to get an ARC of one of the most anticipated romances of the year.Firstly, the author's heartfelt, genuine, and honest letter at the beginning truly warmed my heart and increased my interest! Her creative writing has reached new heights with each book. Her connection with her true feelings also enhances her character development, making it easy for readers to engage with each character, embracing their flaws, mistakes, eccentricities, and unique antics.In this novel, we not only witness Henry’s character evolving throughout three books but also see a perfect depiction of the author’s blossoming creativity. She gives us unforgettable, easy-to-love characters, each with a well-developed voice.Henry and Halle are the best quirky, one-of-a-kind couple I've rooted for! I loved their slow-burn friends-to-lovers story: how they work on themselves, learn to communicate honestly, and form meaningful relationships, leaving behind their flaws.Their meet-cute happens when Henry accompanies Aurora to her book club meeting to choose leadership books to become a great hockey captain, a consuming job he pours his soul into. Instead of picking a book, he crashes the book club to devour the cookies made by Halle Jacobs: an overachiever, the sweetest person, who struggles with saying “no” to anyone.Henry is impressed not only by her baking skills but also by this pretty, quirky, sweet woman. He discovers she can help him with a class he's struggling in, using her unique teaching technique that worked wonders for her sister Gigi, who also has ADHD.Henry wants to return the favor to Halle, who recently broke up with her egotistical boyfriend Will, a hockey player who gaslighted her into thinking little of herself. When Halle rejected sex, Will ended things.Henry knows Will is a douchebag and that Halle never loved him. He also learns that when they broke up, Halle lost her mutual friends, making her more insecure. She’s always put others first, thanks to her overbearing mother who dumped all family problems on her. For the first time, Halle decides to do something for herself by joining a writing competition that offers a free course in NYC as a reward. This means she has to write the romance novel she’s dreamed of but postponed due to her responsibilities and people-pleasing nature. However, when she sits down to write, she’s blocked because of her lack of romantic experience.Henry finds a way to help by offering to date her without crossing friend-zone boundaries, to help her break her writer's block. Halle agrees, and their ""dating project"" helps both of them break down their walls, exploring their true selves together. Halle starts writing, and the words flow onto the screen. But they had one rule: Halle couldn’t fall in love with Henry. She was sure she wouldn't, but what if their friendship turns into something more? What if Henry starts feeling the same way, feeling unhappy when other guys flirt with her? What if they abandon the rule book and take a chance on happiness together?Overall, this is my favorite book in the series, earning five blazing hockey, quirky lovers stars! I also enjoyed the cameos of my favorite characters and seeing how their stories evolved. This is a must-read, one of the most unputdownable, sweet, and sexy reads of the year that I highly recommend!Many thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me this fantastic ARC, which made me cry and dance with happiness. I highly appreciate it in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
"982","199798652","4 starsI ve been waiting for this book and I can say that it was totally worth waiting.The storyline was much more than I expected,there were lots of points where I felt close to halle,with the eldest daughter problems,her loneliness and with her past relationship.I wasn't expecting this book would make me cry,and make me feel deeper emotions than just romance.But it did.I did my makeup today and it ended up ruining after I finish this book from both sad and happy tears.And for Henry,he is the daydream itself.Other than his kindness and his beautiful personality I loved him because he made halle feeling less lonely even when he was dealing with his own problems.What it bothered me just a little was them not labelling themselves but I understood why they behaved this way.This book has been my favorite out of the series.The smut was proper,not too much and it gave me butterflies while reading.And most of all I'm so happy to see other boys and girls,the family.I missed them",4
"983","199798652","so sad but this ends at a 2.5 ⭐️ spoiler free part of the reviewthis was... disappointing, to say the least. I thoroughly enjoyed Henry's ADHD representation and thought that was done well. Halle was a people-pleaser and had an eldest-daughter curse so she said yes to everyone and everything and didn't know how to say no or put herself first. By the end, I loved seeing her yell and argue and stand up for herself. ➳Their relationship was cute. They were both there to support each other and they had really sweet moments. Was it worth the length of this book? No.➳Side characters are there but everyone seems to be in distress. Nate is away, Stassie is stressing; Aurora is weird and Russ is a teddybear; Kris, Robbie, Bobbie and whoeevr the fuck else exist and I still don't even know who they are three books later (Robbie is in a wheelchair? I never knew this?) The biggest downfall was how BORING this was. Oh my god. I was seventy percent through and the book should have finished then. I want you to be mindful of this: the book starts at the beginning of a fall semester. AND WE NEED TO GET THROUGH TO MARCH for Halle's character arc to be complete. When I read Icebreaker (5/5 stars for me), I didn't notice and/or mind how long it was. Wildfire was a bit of a slog, and I noticed it was unnecesarily long. But this one? Holy moly. SO unnecessarily long. And i love long books! I've read a 700-page fantasy in one day. But please. It took me a week to read this and this was the one release this year I was so looking forward to, and I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. I dreaded the fact that I had to pick this up and read it because I was so bored. 
  
    This part is going to be me ranting, since I'm very disappointed by this book. Spoilers ahead, so beware
  
Since I really did love Icebreaker and even Wildfire, I was so esctatic to get this. But I think my tolerance for the way this author writes has worn thin, between the choppy sentences or weird paragraphs that have no place or rhyme or reason to be there. I kept thinking to myself as I was reading, ""This paragraph could have been deleted and nothing would have changed"" or ""This could have been the leading chapter paragraph and we wouldn't have missed anything."" Because why are you trying to waste my time with these unnecessary, dragging details? There are so many redundant conversations between EVERYBODY.  ➳Russ and Henry—him essentially telling him over and over again that he doesn't need to stress about being a good captain, etc. There's at least forty pages covered on this.  ➳Henry and Halle—I love good communication. not when they are communciating the same point over and over again and getting nowhere. I feel like they went in circles. I don't like labels? You don't either? Cool! You need space? I'll give you space, but I'll be sad about it. Pout pout. Like get a grip.  ➳Halle couldn't stand up for herself to save her fucking life. Like seriously grow a spine.Going into this, you think it's going to be a jock x tutor dynamic and while that is true, it's not the way you think it will be. They essentially befriend each other first, then just spend all of their time together, and then they decide to help each other out. And henry is great—he has a care kit for girls, let's not forget!!—but I wish there was more tension. I felt no butterflies. No fuzzies. Nothing. Because they seamlessly just... fit. Halle lives in her grandmother's house. Yes, you heard that right. Homegirl has a whole ass house to herself that her mother pays for. Unrealistic for a twenty year old, but okay. On the topic of unrealistic things, I truly do not believe Halle had time to do half of the things she always said she had to, nevertheless all of them. And adding onto more unrealistic things, Henry asks his friends (Russ, aurora, etc) to literally help Halle through her laundry list of never ending people-pleasing tasks by grocery shopping for her or buying christmas presents for her relatives. I dont care how good of a friend group you say you have—aint nobody doing all that. Another trope is the virgin trope. Our heroine, Halle, is a virgin. I will reiterate since I think it's important that I do so that I LOVED ICEBREAKER AND WILDFIRE!!!—I thought their spice level was pretty good. The spice in this book is nearly nonexistent. It's also a slow burn, since halle is a virgin. Obviously. And it wasn't even good. Like... Henry. I thought you had more game than this babygirl. I was lowkey embarrassed for the both of them LMAO.And of course, we have Halle's ex boyfriend, Will, who keeps coming back like a fucking cold sore you can't get rid of. Halle literally goes to his house in the middle of the book because her younger sister ends up there, and barely tells Henry. Like girl what? There's also this other subplot for Halle submitting a writing prompt for... whatever reason, hence why she needs Henry's help with getting ""experience"" to write something good. This is the backdrop for the whole book—her trying to get material for her own book (which the premise sucks, by the way, more secondhand embarrassment)—and by the end, it doesn't even get chosen. So all of that for what? Literally everyone dropped their entire lives to help her finish this and it didn't even get picked. Girl don't quit your day job!!! keep daydreaming!!!Now listen. There were good parts. Halle found a group of girl friends which is hard as a girl in your 20s when you're introverted and had your entire life grown around a man. Her and henry's relationship really was sweet, even if emotionally codependent. But it was just so long, so boring, at parts icky and cringey. To say i'm not disappointed by this would be a lie. And it's a 2.5, which is not a horrible rating, but I was really expecting something spectacular. And sure, that can be on me, but when I rated both other books 4 stars and higher, excuse me for having expectations. It's possible I've outgrown this juvenile, college-life style of books. Maybe I don't care about twenty-year old's problems when they're this stupid. The writing is not the best (you don't ""have a shower"" you ""take a shower"") and I might just prefer something with a little more... intellect. My initial review, ""This is going to be so good I just know it,"" could not be more wrong, but I digress. --thank you netgalley for the arc!!!--THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD I JUST KNOW IT",2

"985","199798652","Oh, where do I even begin with ""Daydream""? This book has completely stolen my heart, and I'm not sure I want it back! Hannah Grace has crafted a story that's like a warm hug on a chilly day – comforting, sweet, and leaving you with a lingering sense of contentment.Can we take a moment to appreciate the humor in this book? Grace has a knack for blending emotional depth with genuinely funny moments. I found myself chuckling out loud one minute and reaching for tissues the next. It's this balance that makes ""Daydream"" such a joy to read.Now, I will say that if you're looking for non-stop tension and drama, this might not be the book for you. The conflict here is more internal, with both Halle and Henry working through their own issues. Their romance is a steady, comforting presence rather than a rollercoaster of highs and lows. Personally, I found this refreshing, but I can see how some readers might crave more external conflict.In the end, ""Daydream"" is a book about growth, self-discovery, and the transformative power of love – both romantic and platonic. It's about finding your place in the world and the people who make you feel at home. Hannah Grace has created a story that will stay with me for a long time, and I can't recommend it enough.So, if you're in the mood for a book that will make you laugh, cry, and believe in the power of love and friendship, pick up ""Daydream"". Just be prepared to have your heart completely stolen by Halle and Henry. Don't say I didn't warn you!Thank you @prhinternacional for the ARC",4
"986","199798652","4 ★buckle up guys, i have a lot of thoughts.BUT, we have to start with a quote ofc...
  “Thank you for being on my team, Henry.”“Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.”
this is gonna be a ramble because i don't want to forget my thoughts...so one of the first things i felt/realized in the book is i felt like the author was trying to get us to relate to henry or halle SO MUCH. halle's a people pleaser, and henry has a lot of issues with dating and working on himself. i feel like at times it was super pushed to get us to relate to them, and in a few ways i did.in the blurb, halle is described as a bookworm and her writing her own book for a competition. let me tell you, her being a bookworm does not contribute AT ALL to the book besides a few little mentions. there was a few cute scenes from her writing her book but i wish it contributed so much more than it did.I LOVE HENRY. henry is so adorable... i feel like if you read this as a standalone and not the previous two books you wouldn't be in love with henry as much at all, imo. it's harder to understand him, for example when he tells halle not to cry i feel like you need the backup information from his days before halle.i feel like the biggest reason this wasn't 5 stars is i didn't really care for the romance. i wasn't rooting for them, tbh i felt indifferent. i didn't feel pining or longing for them to get together in the book. yeah, i thought they were cute a few times but i wasn't giggling, on the edge of my seat waiting for them to get together, i wasn't super invested.as a people pleaser, i definitely related to halle which is why i feel like i didn't fall in love with her because she reminds me of myself. not being able to say no, putting everyone before yourself etc. i don't really know how to explain this but i feel like they both had so much issues?? that sounds rude but that's not what i mean lol. i feel like they both needed time to work on themselves especially after halle became friends with henry right after her breakup with will.the timeline was so confusing... there was so many gaps. in one of the first chapters when they meet it's cute and all and then when we get to henry's POV it's talking about him seeing her weeks ago... uhm what were they doing during that?? i need the tea. there's also some gaps in the last parts of the book as well. also, her being a tutor was basically abandoned around halfway through (i don't exactly remember when lol), it just kind of disappears without explanation.overall i gave this four stars because i absolutely love henry, but at times i was genuinely like what when he kept being so “don't cry, halle, it overwhelms me” or him calling her dramatic and it genuinely hurt her 😭 maybe it's because i don't struggle with the same exact things henry does but after a while i was like just comfort her dude 😭BUT THE FIRST 100 PAGES. i thought i was gonna give this 5 stars because those ones were PERFECTTT. anyways guys i'm super excited to see everyone's thoughts when y'all read this 🤭coming back to this 5 minutes later and i want to say how much i appreciate THE LACK OF SMUT. icebreaker gets a lot of hate for it, but this one has more emotional intimacy i feel like since it wasn't a spicy scene every three chapters 🙂‍↕️",4

"990","199798652","✭  3.5 stars    “What’re you daydreaming about?” You. Always you.  Henry Turner is having a rough junior year—he's stuck in a difficult class with a professor he can’t stand and suddenly finds himself as the hockey team captain, a job he didn’t even want. Things get interesting when he accidentally crashes Halle Jacobs' book club. Halle, a super smart student who’s juggling her own busy life agrees to help Henry out with his class, hoping it’ll help her break through her writer's block. As they work together, they make a deal not to fall in love, but sticking to that rule might be harder than they thought. ➸ I thought this book was really cute, but it had the potential to be so much better. I enjoyed it overall, but I found myself getting bored pretty quickly and didn’t feel super engaged with the story at all times. The timeline got a little confusing and had so many gaps. This seems to be a recurring issue with Hannah Grace’s books for me—they’re usually good but don’t quite hit the “amazing” mark. It’s like they have a lot of promise but don’t always deliver the way I hope they will. I think this one is probably my least favourite in the Maple Hills series which is sort of disappointing since I’ve been looking forward to Henry’s book for ages since he seemed like such a sweet character in the previous books. Henry and Halle are both really endearing, and their relationship is healthy and heartwarming. However, I wanted to feel more depth in the romance and the book overall. If you’re into feel-good romances with relatable characters and a low-conflict relationship, you’ll probably enjoy this. It’s a nice comfort read, but I was hoping for a bit more tension and passion. Halle ౨ৎ Halle is definitely my favourite female character in this series! She’s an aspiring writer, a romance enthusiast, and a total bookworm. As the eldest sibling in her family, she’s always been the go-to person—whether it’s helping with homework, organising family trips, or managing everyone’s emotional needs. Her role as the responsible oldest child means she’s constantly putting everyone else’s needs before her own, which is a struggle I could really empathise with. Halle’s journey throughout the book is pretty inspiring. Watching her break free from her people-pleasing tendencies and start standing up for herself was so gratifying. She begins to shift her focus toward self-love and setting boundaries, which is a huge step for her. It’s refreshing to see a character grow in such a meaningful way. One of the standout moments for me was the conversation Halle had with her mother. It was a pivotal and emotional scene that truly highlighted Halle’s growth. Instead of her mother reacting with frustration or anger, she actually listens to Halle’s struggles and offers the understanding and support she needs. This moment was so important because it showed a realistic and compassionate approach to resolving conflicts and supporting loved ones. It made Halle’s journey feel even more relatable and real. Henry ౨ৎ In this book, we really dive into Henry’s complex personality, and it’s both fascinating and heartbreaking to see his internal battles. As the captain of the hockey team, Henry is under a lot of pressure, and his ADHD only complicates things further. Being neurodivergent affects almost every part of his life, from his relationships to his schoolwork. I really enjoyed getting to know Henry better. He struggles with filtering his thoughts and worries about accidentally hurting others, but he genuinely tries to understand Halle and comfort her when she’s upset—even though he’s not the best at handling emotional situations himself. On top of all that, Henry is struggling with one of his classes because the teaching style doesn’t work well for him. He’s trying to juggle the demands of being captain with the need to keep his grades up, especially since his coach has high expectations. This constant balancing act leaves him feeling incredibly overwhelmed. His effort to manage all these pressures makes his character really compelling and relatable.Henry and Halle are such a unique and endearing couple, and I really enjoyed rooting for them! Their slow-burn journey from friends to lovers was captivating, especially as they worked on personal growth, learned to communicate openly, and built a deep connection while addressing their imperfections. Sometimes, it felt like Halle and Henry had so many issues going on in their personal lives that their romance just didn’t get the spotlight. The book seemed more interested in exploring healthy relationships and the value of friendship rather than diving into their love story specifically. There weren’t a ton of romantic moments between them, so by the end, I felt like they were more like really close friends than a couple.  Some issues that I had:  - Halle and Henry’s communication was supposed to be a strong point, but honestly, it felt like they were just stuck in a loop, endlessly repeating themselves. The dialogues were so long they made parts of the book drag on and become pretty monotonous.- There were times when the plot just stalled and felt like it was going nowhere, making the story seem aimless. I kept waiting for something to happen or for the narrative to pick up, but it never really did.- I was really looking forward to the tutor-jock dynamic, but that angle pretty much disappears halfway throughOverall, this book was definitely cute and had its share of charming moments. If you’re a fan of feel-good reads with relatable characters and a focus on friendship over conflict, then this book is right up your alley! However, I couldn’t help but wish for a bit more tension and passion in the story. The lack of conflict and the overall laid-back approach to the romance left me craving more excitement and emotional depth. ♥ Quotes & Moments ♥  ❀  “You always make me feel pretty.” “You feel like that because you are pretty, Halle.”  ❀  This might be my favourite romance book, but we’re my favourite love story. ────⋆.˚ ✩ ⋆˙⟡────༘*⁀➷ pre-read: So excited to dive into this one! Feels like I've been waiting for Henry's book since forever.",3
"991","199798652","REVIEW! ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ 4.5 stars -`♡´- spoiler free | Thank you edelweiss and simon and schuster for giving me the opportunity to read this one month before it's release in exchange of my honest review⭑.ᐟ 𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐑𝐎:AHHHH I have so many thoughts and I'm going to try my best to put them all in a coherent way. The first thing I want to adress is Hannah Grace what kind of magic did you do? This book was SO GOOD I physically cannot belive this is the same author that wrote ""dicknotized"". The only characters I liked in icebreaker were JJ and Henry so when this book was announced I immediatly wanted to read this, I started reading PRAYING that she wouldn't ruin Henry and safe to say Hannah made me love him even more. NO insta-love, NO smut until 50%, and NO sex until 70% 😦 . I know I probably have low standards for Hannah Grace but I was constantly comparing this to the deal by elle kenedy that has a similar plot and I rated 4 stars and if you liked that one you’ll probably like this one too. I think this is my new favorite hockey romance 🤭. ₊˚⊹♡ Anyways this review is for the girls like me that rated icebreaker a 1 KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN, I promise it's worth it. When it comes out READ IT it's such a wholesome read.⭑.ᐟ 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐓𝐄𝐑𝐒:𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒ 𝘏𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦She is a bookworm, a fellow romance reader, a swiftie, and an aspiring writter. She is the eldest daughter and she constantly stuggles with putting everyone else's needs before her own. People pleasers core, she literally rearanges her whole schedule just so she can accomodate her exboyfriend who is also a hockey player. She is everything to me 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️, and by far the most likeable fmc of this series.𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒ 𝘏𝘦𝘯𝘳𝘺THE PERFECT MAN, not only does he keep a box of stuff in case any girl stays over (which includes cramps pills and hair ties) but he is actually the sweetest man ever. He is neurodivergent and he struggles trying to filter himself so he won't hurt people but he tries SO hard to understand Halle, and even comforts her when she cries even though he's highly uncomfortable with other people crying. He buys her a necklace with his initial on it 😭😭 (yes they share initials but she said it was for him). I could talk about Henry all day long but I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll just say this man has all the love languages, touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, you name it and he does it. I'm quoting my update but he is a man raised by two woman and IT FREAKING SHOWS. ⭑.ᐟ 𝐏𝐋𝐎𝐓: Halle gets broken up at the beggining of this book by her best and only friend named Will, why you may ask? because she won't have sex with him and he as the andrew tate listener that he is decides that he deserves better 💀 (I FUCKING HATE WILL). Anywho, with the break up Halle realizes that all of the people she thought were her friends were actually only Will's, tired of feeling sorry for herself she decides it's finally time to do something for herself. So she enters a writting competition with the prize of a free course in New York. She's writting a romance book, BUT she realizes she hasn't expirienced any of the things she's writting about so she's stuck.At the same time my man Henry is struggling in one of his classes, as he neurodivergent and the teacher's style doesn't work for him so he's struggling. Dangling a position as captain in the hockey team and keeping his grades perfect as his coach won't accept anything less, Henry is left feeling overwhelmed. He is dragged by Aurora to a bookstore to buy leadership books to help with his dilema. There he meets Halle while she hosts her romance bookclub (SHE RUNS A ROMACE BOOKCLUB 😍😍). She offers to help him with his class as she has a neurodivergent sister and knows easier ways to help them learn, and he (as the beautiful man he is) offers to help her too because he doesn't want to ""abuse her kindness"", so in exchange he will help her write her book by giving her the expiriences she lacks.""Thank you for being on my team, Henry.” “Thank you for giving me the love I could never picture.”“And how does it make you feel? Now that you can picture it?” He’s quiet while he thinks. “Like I’m living in my daydreams. So, pretty damn happy.”⭑.ᐟ 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐓𝐇𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐇𝐓𝐒: I did NOT expect to like this as much as I did, Hannah Grace you have truly redeemed yourself. This was sweet and wholesome and it is truly impossible it belongs to the same series as icebreaker. I know I shouldn't compare but it's hard not to when the same characters I used to hate are here being nice and normal. Henry and Halle were wholesome, they were sweet, they understood each other and took care of one another, and more importantly THEY COMMUNICATE 🎉🎉🎉 *applauses*. I HATE SMUT SOOO MUCH, but the way it was written in this book made me not hate it and also it was actually a pretty heartfelt scene 😭, he doesn't pressure her into anything like her ex and he is the most patient and attentive man ever. To the bio he goes.I can't say much without spoiling so I will end it here, this is your sign to add this to your tbr immediatly.",5

"995","199798652","FINALLY a five star for August omg. I related a little too much to Halle, like the author was IN MY HEAD lol. Eldest daughters unite. Not me tearing up during the spicy scene. And Henry was the sweetest. I absolutely adored everything about this book! I feel like the author's writing has improved so much since Icebreaker and Wildfire. The previous books were definitely more focused on the romance, while Daydream felt like an introspective character book + college coming-of-age(ish) story with romantic undertones. I really liked how Daydream focused on the hockey less so in a sports way but in a leadership way and Henry's struggles to balance everything. This was also pretty tame on the spicy scenes. There weren't that many, and as aforementioned, I was trying to to cry during one of them. LOL. But I related SO SO much to Halle. I think a lot of readers will see themselves in Halle (as cliche as that is lol) because she struggles with being a people pleaser, managing her family dynamics, forming meaningful friendships, etc. Sometimes I feel like when authors write characters that are people pleasers, the way that it's written seems a bit on the nose and surface level, but that wasn't AT ALL the case here. Halle was a ""subtle"" people pleaser where everyone relied on her for emotional support and she subconsciously feels inclined to give it. And when she said something like ""name something about me that you like that's not something I did for you."" OMG. Now Henry. He needs to be wrapped in a blanket, he's the sweetest book boyfriend. Both he and Halle were written in a way that felt three-dimensional, they had strengths but also flaws. The way Henry cared for Halle in his own unique was was adorable. And I really liked that he wasn't this big macho extroverted hockey player? It's so nice to read a hockey romance book with an introverted MMC who's not grumpy and rude. Also loved how many Aurora and Russ cameos there were. And I feel like perhaps the author is building to a Lola and Robbie book? Possibly with long distance and second chance...?",5

"998","199798652","I think this book was supposed to be about a young woman triumphing over childhood trauma that resulted in her being a parentified, anxious adult but it’s actually about a woman whose only personality trait is that she loathes herself. She can’t communicate for shit, she only grows as a person when other people are forcing her to, and nothing is ever her idea. We are products of our environments, and her environment sucked, so I’m not necessarily blaming her, but that doesn’t mean I was happy to read 400 pages of her not believing anyone when they tell her they don’t hate her. The guy is marginally better - he was raised by lesbians so he’s like, an Ultra Feminist or something - but there is no evidence that Halle experienced any evolution independent of Henry’s guidance and friend group, so what’s the point? There’s a cute cat, I guess.",2
